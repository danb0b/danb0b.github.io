It is a way to have vast, disparate sources of data come together in networked way in order to perform tasks important to robotics, such as simulation, sensing, control, learning, and teleoperation. It coordinates the transfer of information from one place to another in a way that is scalable\nIntegration The IDEAlab has a number of disparate pieces of hardware, each of which is controlled using a mix of standardized and proprietary protocols. It is important to be able to access that data in a standardized way so that we can run experiments more efficiently\nEach device typically has an API or protocol that we can use to communicate with it, but these protocols are not standardized (nor should they be). In the past, when creating experimental data collection setups, we would write individual Matlab or Python-based scripts to communicate with the specific devices we needed. This led to non-standardized code with situation-specific instructions making it difficult to reuse the code for new purposes, limiting sharing. Secondly, as multiple devices were often integrated together within some sort of while loop, communication from multiple sources at different rates led to common problems with buffering and asynchronous communication, leading to poor performance. Through ROS, we have more control over each devices communication rate in a way that is non-blocking and variable depending on need.\nHigh Level Overview There are a variety of terms used for the parts of ROS, and while there are good tutorials out there, it is nice to see a quick summary of terms in one place.\nItem Description Master the computer that coordinates communication sent over ROS Node A node is a program compiled to interact with ros topics. Nodes can be run on different PC\u0026rsquo;s and communicate over communication layer Service Like a node, except that services respond to requests rather than publish at their own discretion Message particular data type that gets passed between nodes Topic A category of messages that a node can subscribe to Package collections of nodes, messages, and data types that work together as a project. They are written in python and/or C++ launch file a method for starting up a number of ros nodes, services and topics. synchronizes the startup of ros stuff publish how to send data over ROS subscribe how to select and receive data published over ROS Devices Some examples of the types of devices we need to communicate with include:\nEthernet-based data from standalone robotic systems UR-5 and UR-5e Wifi-based microcontrollers suh as the Photon. ATI LAN-based sensors Camera data from USB webcams or ethernet-accessible computers like the Raspberry Pi. Ethernet-based motion tracking systems like Optitrack. USB-based devices connected to a local or remote computer Novint Falcon Thorlabs Linear Stage Serial over USB data to/from microcontrollers connected to a computer, for custom sensing Accelerometer Data from I2C based chips Current data from current sensing chips Analog data from I/O pins Dynamixel Servos Load Cells PCI-card-based devices with drivers available only in Windows, like NI hardware etc\u0026hellip; The variety of these devices, their connection to a computer, and their specific constraints, is the reason we have chosen ROS for our integration effort. We have determined that ROS can satisfy those needs while remaining relatively accessible to students in terms of the learning curve and complexity.\nROS Capabilities ROS is capable of performing a number of tasks critical for robotics research\nData Collection Once routed into ROS, it is important to select which pieces of data to gather, process and publish. Our needs at this point are mostly related to collection, processing, filtering, and recording that data. Future work will relate to closing the loop with control.\nData Processing Data can be processed within the ROS environment. One standard way to do that would be to have a separate node \u0026ndash; a program that runs within its own process \u0026ndash; subscribing to a stream of data, doing something with it, and then publishing a derivative of that work. Examples include\ntaking camera data from two cameras and to combine it into a 3d image. filtering noisy sensor data compressing an image extracting raw load cell data and converting it into a resultant force and location. Recording Data can also be recorded using ROS, by subscribing to different topics and logging everything as it comes in into a \u0026ldquo;bag\u0026rdquo; file. This functionality also permits replaying the same data as it came in, for subsequent processing later\nViewing and Interacting ROS also has the capability to view and interact with different kinds of data\ntext data can be printed to a terminal or viewed in a GUI image data can be subscribed to and viewed using a native viewer Custom nodes can be composed in Python or C++ that permit one to display and control pieces of data from one interface. Versions This tutorial is set up assuming Ubuntu 18 and ROS Melodic. Things will change, but for ROS 1 and Ubuntu, this can serve as a rough roadmap even in other versions. Some instructions may change over time and this will be updated to reflect that as needed.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/notebook/deprecated/ros/00-overview/","tags":["ros","ubuntu","linux"],"title":"Overview"},{"categories":null,"contents":"What is SSH A way of securely and remotely connecting to another computer over tcp.\nSSH Client Common command form\nssh user@\u0026lt;server-or-ip\u0026gt; -p \u0026lt;portnum\u0026gt; -i \u0026lt;identity/file/path\u0026gt; SSH One-liner you can run a single command on a remote machine like this\nssh user@server \u0026#39;command\u0026#39; for example:\nssh danaukes@mycomputer \u0026#39;echo \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;test.txt\u0026#39; Common arguments -p: port number -i: identity path file -v / -vv / -vvv / -vvvv: levels of \u0026ldquo;verbosity\u0026rdquo; -o: options you can specify SSH Client Configuration You can configure your ssh client on a per-server basis with the .ssh/config file\nNote: this is an example, don\u0026rsquo;t just copy/paste\nBelow we see an example\nHost \u0026lt;name or *\u0026gt; # if you want to restrict your ssh client to only using keys IdentitiesOnly yes # supply the default path to your identity file (key) IdentityFile \u0026lt;path/to/new_file\u0026gt; # default username User \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; # ForwardAgent yes # set this option carefully AddKeysToAgent yes # set this option carefully ...many other options The first entry to match will be used, so make sure you put more general rules, such as Host * at the end.\nyou can find more info here:\nhttps://linuxhandbook.com/ssh-config-file/ https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/config https://linuxize.com/post/using-the-ssh-config-file/ or by typing\nman ssh_config SSH Keys Create a new SSH key Use a key like \u0026ldquo;ed25519\u0026rdquo;\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f \u0026lt;path/to/key\u0026gt; Select a passphrase\nprint the public key:\ncat \u0026lt;path/to/key\u0026gt;.pub add your key(s) to authorized keys:\nThere are many ways you can do this.

Keys are a standardized and secure approach to connecting to other machines, in a way that prevents many of the issues of remembering, using, and storing passwords. However, if you still enable passwords to be used, you can be sure someone will try.\nIn order to make SSH accessible, some of the default settings are too permissive. The following tutorial helps you remove older and less secure connection methods, turn off common but typically unnecessary settings, and disable passwords.\nIt should be mentioned that if you follow these steps over a remote connection, you should 1) keep an existing connection to your remote server while you implement these changes, and 2) make sure you have a secondary way to gain access should you mess up a step.\nSteps First, remember to add your public key to the server\u0026rsquo;s .ssh/authorized keys file, so you can still log in remotely.

Because many students don\u0026rsquo;t have a spare computer they can load Ubuntu on, a virtual machine often makes sense. The most recent versions of virtualbox are quite adept and providing full support to usb devices piped in through a windows host, making this a nice, general solution for developing ROS environments.\nNomenclature If you are installing a linux virtual machine on your windows computer, your windows computer is called the \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo;, and the linux virtual machine is called the \u0026ldquo;guest\u0026rdquo;\nHost Computer Installation You will need some packages installed on the host side to communicate with your guest(virtual) machine\nInstall Python, preferably via the Anaconda distribution\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need some additional packages. From a command prompt:\npip install service_identity roslibpy C/C++ Compiler (optional). Only required if you will be installing python packages on Windows that need to be compiled.\nInstall Virtualbox. This tutorial was written for Virtualbox 6, though I don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate major functionality changes between neighboring versions. Install the latest version.\nInstall the virtualbox extension pack as well\nInstall Putty for networked ssh acess\nDownload Ubuntu You probably want Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) desktop edition. Make sure you download an .iso file so that the virutal machine can load it.\nNote: The ROS version you want to use impacts which Ubuntu version you should select. They are paired together.\nCreating the Guest Machine The next steps outline how to go about creating a Virtual Machine similar to the one used in this tutorial.\nCreate Virtual Machine 4Gb Ram 50Gb HD, flexible size option 1-2 cpus load ubuntu 18.04 iso Install Ubuntu minimum install no 3rd party drivers no downloads during install username: idealab pw: idealab sign in automatically take a snapshot of the virtual machine at this point. If anything goes wrong you can go back to this point Set up the Virtual Machine to prepare for ROS install Note: All these steps should be run within the guest.\nHint: To open up a terminal, remember the handy keyboard-based shortcut of ctrl+alt+t\ninstall guest additions\nFirst, run this in the terminal\nsudo apt install -y virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-dkms Install the virtualbox guest additions cd from the guest os window and select run when the button pops up.\nlet it run\neject the cd from the virtualbox host menu\nRestart guest computer (using the guest menu in the top right corner)\nInstall other packages. See Ros Prerequisites\nTake another Snapshot\nInstalling ROS Follow the detailed installation instructions at https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu, or follow the condensed instructions in the next section.\nGuest Network Setup Power down your guest machine from within the guest OS (top right corner of the screen)\nOnce powered down, in your host machine, change the virtualbox network settings to \u0026ldquo;bridged adapter\u0026rdquo; mode\nAssign a custom MAC address to the guest in the advanced preferences menu. This will make your virtual machine easier to identify for further network setup\nYou can use something like 000000000001 to make it easy to remember, but never use the same MAC address for multiple machines on the same network. It is supposed to be a unique identifier. Start the guest machine again\nFind the ip address of ethernet port in the terminal\n#sudo apt install -y net-tools ifconfig -v this will return information about each networking device, that looks like this:\nenp0s3: flags=4163\u0026lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST\u0026gt; mtu 1500 inet 192.168.0.17 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255 inet6 2600:8800:2281:3600:a6d7:41a9:9d6b:e48b prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0\u0026lt;global\u0026gt; inet6 fe80::7804:5434:c83:a827 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20\u0026lt;link\u0026gt; inet6 2600:8800:2281:3600:588c:62a0:442a:d6ce prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0\u0026lt;global\u0026gt; ether 08:00:27:00:80:00 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 47127 bytes 47300474 (47.3 MB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 13563 bytes 1385399 (1.3 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 lo: flags=73\u0026lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING\u0026gt; mtu 65536 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x10\u0026lt;host\u0026gt; loop txqueuelen 1000 (Local Loopback) RX packets 117914 bytes 20197993 (20.1 MB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 117914 bytes 20197993 (20.1 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 The value you want is the \u0026ldquo;inet\u0026rdquo; value under, in this case, enp0s3, or 192.168.0.17 in our case. Remember this value, this is how you will communicate with your virtual pc\nAssign a static ip address (optional) You can do this in your router or within the guest machine; this will enable you to communicate with this machine at a known address.\nOption 1: Router-specific instructions Please see the router specific instructions for reserving a specific IP address (using the guest machine\u0026rsquo;s custom MAC address) using DHCP. You must have administrator access to your router\nOption 2: Within the Guest Open up the network configuration (top right hand corner of the screen near power) and follow the menu system to assign a custom IP4 address to your ethernet controller. You should be comfortable with networking concepts and have a firm understanding of your network topology before modifying this setting, or other computers will no longer be able to communicate with this computer.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/notebook/deprecated/ros/01-virtualbox-setup/","tags":["ros","ubuntu","linux","virtualbox"],"title":"Virtualbox Setup (optional)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Flashing Make sure you\nadd your ssh key during flashing setup wifi define a hostname Tailscale turn on magicdns sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER -accept-dns=true --accept-routes=true Installing It\u0026rsquo;s important to disable automatic updates as you should initiate it according to your own availability.

This article details the steps required to do the same in docker. Docker is much lighter weight to set up than a virtual machine, and is a useful choice if you want to test your network.\nKey points of this article:\nHow to assign a unique ip address to a docker container that is visible on your physical network, making it usable for ROS communication with non-docker devices. How to configure unicast, specifically cyclonedds, to work with a docker container, to avoid multicast issues on your local network. How to embed this logic in a self-contained, multi-container application using docker compose.

If you change anything in the dockerfile and want to rebuild, you can use the command.\ndocker compose up --force-recreate --build Despite all flags, if docker sees a locally cached layer, it will not rebuild or re-acquire it. This means you may also need to use:\ndocker build --no-cache -t \u0026lt;image-name\u0026gt; /path/to/dockerfile if you want to docker to rebuild without any cached layers (for example if the build command hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed but the online repo has been updated.)\nTesting Finally, rundocker compose up to run the containers in the foreground. To kill the containers you can use ctrl+c.

Just get your tailscale client up and running on the host computer, and your docker instance can use it.\nInstructions First, go to the administrative interface at tailscale.com and ensure that the magicdns feature is enabled.\nThis allows your computers to refer to each other by name rather than IP address.\nThis setup requires that you have downloaded and installed virtualbox on your host machine (the computer running docker).

This allows your computers to refer to each other by name rather than IP address.\nAnother important tool for automating the creation of docker containers is the use of pre-defined authorization keys. This tutorial assumes you have created and configured an auth key on tailscale already. This should be stored in an environment variable you define called $DOCKERKEY_PERM. This can be stored in your .bashrc file or any of the other ways made possible by docker and docker-compose files\nNext, pick a folder for housing your docker compose file. I have mine setup in ~/docker/ros2-tailscale/\nCreate a folder called build. Inside the build foder create a file called DOCKERFILE and paste in the following contents:\nFROM osrf/ros:humble-desktop ENV ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0 ENV ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0 ENV FASTRTPS_DEFAULT_PROFILES_FILE=/root/shared/fast.xml ENV RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_fastrtps_cpp RUN apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt install -y \\ ros-humble-rmw-fastrtps-cpp RUN apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt install -y curl RUN curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.noarmor.gpg | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg \u0026gt;/dev/null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ curl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/focal.tailscale-keyring.list | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt install -y tailscale Create a file called docker-compose.yml and paste the following contents inside\nversion: \u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34; services: tailscaled: build: ./build volumes: - ./lib:/var/lib - /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun - ./shared:/root/shared hostname: docker-ub environment: - TS_AUTHKEY=${DOCKERKEY_PERM} - TS_ROUTES=10.0.0.0/8 - TS_USERSPACE=0 - TS_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/tailscale - TS_HOSTNAME=docker1 cap_add: - NET_ADMIN - NET_RAW command: bash -c \u0026#34;tailscaled \u0026amp; tailscale up --authkey ${TS_AUTHKEY} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker\u0026#34; restart: unless-stopped create a subfolder called shared.

Upon installing Ubuntu 20.04, initially the keyboard worked but other aspects of the computer did not, such as being able to control screen brightness, fan speed, etc. After the kernel was automatically updated, however, suddently I was unable to use the keyboard, but intermittently. Each reboot might allow me or not. To add an additional wrinkle, I had also encrypted my hard drive using LUKS, meaning that if I was traveling or did not have access to an external keyboard, I would be locked out.\nInstall a compatible Kernel The first thing I did was to manually install a kernel I could at least unlock my computer with. I followed the instructions here to get the linux 5.8.18 kernel installed.\nList all kernels:\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image Recompile your Kernel The real solution, however, is discussed in this chain of emails, and the solution is discussed here.\nopen software-properties-gtk and enable source code\nFollow instructions to build your own kernel\nget dependencies\nget source ()\napt source linux-image-unsigned-$(uname -r) update configs\nchmod a+x debian/rules chmod a+x debian/scripts/* chmod a+x debian/scripts/misc/* LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules clean LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules editconfigs # you need to go through each (Y, Exit, Y, Exit..) or get a complaint about config late Use the advice from here, update yoru configuration (don\u0026rsquo;t uncheck \u0026ldquo;support for uevent\u0026rdquo;)\nASUS UM425UA internal keyboard doesn\u0026#39;t work on a \u0026#34;cold boot\u0026#34; (first power-on). It activates only after restart. I noticed it when tried to boot live image of Ubuntu 20.04.3 This problem probably appeared with kernel version 5.9 or 5.10 because with Ubuntu 20.04.2 live image (Linux 5.8) keyboard loads fine. Tried kernel 5.14 and it\u0026#39;s still affected. I tried to recompile kernels 5.11 \u0026amp; 5.13 with SERIO_I8042 set as a module (as suggested in an Arch Linux bug report) and keyboard now works from the first start. In \u0026#34;make config\u0026#34; the changes are: Device Drivers -\u0026gt; \u0026gt; Generic Driver Options -\u0026gt; [ ] Support for uevent #may slowdown boot, needed only for U14.04 \u0026gt; Input device support \u0026gt; Keyboards -\u0026gt; [M] AT keyboard \u0026gt; Hardware I/O ports -\u0026gt; [M] i8042 PC Keyboard controller It changed such lines in config: CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=m CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=m CONFIG_SERIO_LIBPS2=m References: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/70384 https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2459149 https://linux.org/threads/asus-zenbook-14-um425ua-keyboard-not-respond-during-cold-boot.33738/#post-133830 P.S. Other option which helped me was a GRUB parameter \u0026#34;i8042.reset=1\u0026#34; but it had a positive effect only with kernel 5.11 These changes break the rules. Modify\nnano debian.master/config/annotations search for \u0026ldquo;CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;CONFIG_SERIO_I8042\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;CONFIG_SERIO_LIBPS2\u0026rdquo; and set amd64 option to \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; for each. Update version number so that the apt repository doesn\u0026rsquo;t supersede it on the next upgrade (according to the ubuntu guide)\nadd a local version modifier like \u0026ldquo;+test1\u0026rdquo; to the end of the first version number in the debian.master/changelog file before building. This will help identify your kernel when running as it also appears in uname -a. Note that when a new Ubuntu kernel is released that will be newer than your kernel (which needs regenerating), so care is needed when upgrading.

Add any number of = or - below the text for heading 1 or heading 2.\nHeading 1 = Heading 2 - Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Text styles Using markdown syntax, we can change texts\u0026rsquo; styles, including bold, italic, blockquotes, monospaced, underlined, strike-through, boxed, subscript, and superscript.\nWe can use two asterisks (**), underscores (__), or an HTML tag \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt; to make a text bold. To make text italic, we can use one asterisk (*), underscore (_), or an HTML tag \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;. Also, we can make the text bold and italic at the same time.\nBold\n**The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.** __The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.__ \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Italic\n*The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.* _The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog._ \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; Bold and Italic\n**_The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog._** \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nBold\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nItalic\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nBold and Italic\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nTo create blockquote, we can use the greater than sign \u0026gt;. We can create a single-line or multi-line blockquote. Also, blockquote inside a blockquote. We can add other text styles inside a blockquote, such as bold or italic text styles.\nBlockquotes \u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt; \u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt; \u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt;\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; **The quick brown fox** *jumps over the lazy dog.* Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nWe can achieve monospaced, and underlined styles using HTML tags \u0026lt;samp\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;ins\u0026gt;. For a strike-through style, we can use two tilda sign ~~.\nMonospaced: \u0026lt;samp\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/samp\u0026gt; Underlined: \u0026lt;ins\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/ins\u0026gt; Strike-through: ~~The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.~~ Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nMonospaced: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nUnderlined: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nStrike-through: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nWe can use an HTML \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; tag to create a box.\nBoxed \u0026lt;table\u0026gt;\u0026lt;tr\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/table\u0026gt; Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

When a new class is created, an object of type `Class` is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Mobile in this case). As you can see the word Class is highlighted.\nWe can also use triple backticks ``` before and after the code block to create the following view.\n```bash public static String monthNames[] = {\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;February\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;March\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;April\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;June\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;July\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;August\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;September\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;October\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;November\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;December\u0026quot;};``` We can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting.

For center-align text, use a colon on both sides of dashes. For right-align text, use a colon to the right of dashes.

The publisher wanted my thoughts on how to refresh it, improve it, and make it current, since the original authors had moved on and didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to make the necessary improvements. Even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to work on it, I put together a writeup on what I thought needed to change, with a justification for why. I thought that writeup might have some utility on its own, so here it is, adjusted for a general audience. Consider my perspective, as someone who teaches introductory courses on mechatronics and embedded systems \u0026ndash; I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to teach everything, so I have to pick and choose, based on what I think will serve my students best as they approach the workforce. These thoughts are therefore already running through my head as I consider how to update and curate my courses.\nBack when I was in school, it was still manageable to attempt to cram everything introductory about electronics, mechatronics or embedded systems into a single handbook or textbook, running in parallel with the courses I once took, and these days teach. The problem with these topics today is that 1) so many devices, products, and concepts have come and gone, that your materials need to be overhauled top to bottom every few years. Additionally, the number of things to know about introductory electronics has both grown and shifted as well. I will give you a brief rundown:\nThe work you have to do to enter electronics has changed Electonics theory doesn\u0026rsquo;t really change, because it\u0026rsquo;s fundamental to how more advanced electronic concepts work. You still need to know Ohm\u0026rsquo;s law, Kirchoff\u0026rsquo;s voltage and current rules, and your basic passive circuit elements. However, what I have observed in the past few years of teaching is that basic thru-hole components (the kind that are easy to put on a breadboard and start playing with) are getting harder to find, and that many companies have \u0026ldquo;productized\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;modularized\u0026rdquo; basic surface mount parts (ala Adafruit, Sparkfun, Mikroe) to provide easier access to more intricate systems on a chip. This is exemplified by Mikroe\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;click\u0026rdquo; boards, for example. Thus, when you can fly, do you need to learn how to walk? Though I believe at the heart of a good education you must learn and practice the basics, most of us don\u0026rsquo;t tear down our calculators before using them. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe most students \u0026ndash; let alone hobbyists \u0026ndash; want or need to start at the beginning; they want to make their systems work now.\nWhen I was learning electronics, we also used to learn about digital circuits from the bottom up, because we still needed to develop our own circuits from scratch. Microprocessors and microcontrollers were not advanced enough to include many of the processing and mapping capabilites they do today. We thus composed logical elements from their base constituents (and,or,not,nand, etc) and used that to augment simple processing architectures. Today, though, microcontrollers and single-board-computers include much of the hardware (or offer expansion boards) that we used to have to build. This means that the focus and tone of a book written today about electronics would be about selecting a chip or chip family (or product ecosystem) that has the right features baked in, rather than designing and selecting 10 discrete parts to form your own analog signal processing circuit or digital system. The best (fastest and easiest) way to craft a system these days is in software, and to do it on whatever $2 chip that has the right blend of on-board features.\nWhile speaking about software, I first learned assembly language in my mechatronics courses, in order to better understand the connection between computer architectures and the software that runs on top of it. We did because of our systems\u0026rsquo; constraints. The limits of memory and program space were such that we had to be innovative in how we coded our systems \u0026ndash; our programs had to be efficient! We sometimes sacrificed program clarity for program efficiency. These days, because the limits of memory and program space are virtually non-existent, we are able to use a variety of higher-level languages without seeing the performance hit they extract on our systems (for good and for ill). Because we are writing simple systems in higher-level languages, and because many of those low-level decisions are made for us by increasingly integrated design tools or high-quality software libraries, our focus in development these days has shifted towards paradigms that are transferrable, safe/secure, and easy to understand, rather than efficient.\nThe landscape of products, and ways to combine them, has also exploded. New programming languages(rust, micropython), new computing platforms (raspberry pi, esp32, psoc, etc), new components (cameras, sensors, motors, and their interfacing components) \u0026ndash; it is too much for one person to catalogue any more in a single \u0026ldquo;Gutenberg library\u0026rdquo; of electronics knowledge. You have to pick and choose.\nTherefore, I think if you were to write a handbook or textbook today, you must be more strategic in what you spend time on. Keep the theory, but get much faster to the parts you need to know today.\nPCB Design and Manufacturing Developing your own circuits has also advanced quite a bit. To affordably make your own PCBs, you once started by designing your own circuits by hand, literally drawing your own circuit on a copper-clad board and then etching away the copper. These days, you can get a $10 board sent from overseas in a week. Thus, the discussion of tools we use to make our own boards needs to be overhauled.\nEliminate a discussion of wire-wrap technology, the \u0026ldquo;transparency\u0026rdquo; method of designing PCBs Update the tools in today\u0026rsquo;s electronics workbench with an eye toward affordability. There are a lot of tools that makes yesterday\u0026rsquo;s lab bench, filled with expensive meters, drivers, and tools \u0026ndash; less essential for those on a budget. Eliminate analog multimeters and oscilloscopes. This is great for historical context, but not what we use any more! You should introduce the dominant free and open source PCB design tools, the idea of how they work, and include a practical walkthrough. KiCAD is my open-source tool of choice, though we have also used Altium and Cadence successfully on the industry-grade side. It would also be useful to discuss simpler tools that exist between a full electronics design and something more hobbyist oriented, such as Fritzing or tinkercad.\nIt is also now possible these days to sink a small amount of money into your own PCB mill in order to develop your own PCBs within the classroom or in your garage. For the serious hobbyist, they would want to know how to do this, what the dominant machines are, and what you need to know to get it working. Because it is so accessible and affordable these days, a discussion of PCB manufacturing would help readers take their designs through to completion by themselves, which is a powerful selling point.\nPower and Voltage Regulation While \u0026ldquo;linear\u0026rdquo; voltage regulators (the kind still used in introductory courses) are still prevalent, switching regulators are much more energy-efficient and are preferred in industry today. The focus on linear regulators should change, since so many more switching regulators are out there, and their setup and use is simpler now (now that they are more advanced and require fewer parts).\nDiscrete Digital Circuit Design While it\u0026rsquo;s cool to learn about the way digital logic forms the basis for all computing, we just don\u0026rsquo;t compose digital circuits like that any more \u0026ndash; by composing digital circuits from individual components (740X series, anyone?). I suggest trimming it down or eliminating it.\nAnalog Circuitry Analog signal conditioning, and its associated hardware (Op Amps) are are still a good topic to learn, but it is important to recognize that there are far fewer analog interfaces in use in modern electronics than digital. Thus, while you \u0026ldquo;have to know\u0026rdquo; how analog signals are conditioned and passed along, analog data is now often quickly digitized and then massaged via digital techniques. This should be expanded upon in beginner textbooks and curricula for early learners. Something about digital filters, \u0026ldquo;discrete\u0026rdquo; systems, and modern computing examples should be added to todays first courses and handbooks.\nSensing The theory of sensing is still great to know. In class, I still teach about capacitive sensing, inductive sensing, resistive sensing, and show how to connect these basic elements to custom-designed analog signal conditioning circuits. This is great to learn, know, and understand, and I\u0026rsquo;m on the fence whether we should throw the baby out with the bathwater, but the reality is that most actual sensors on the market today are somewhat disconnected from this theory. Many sensor chips are in fact complete systems in their own right, with logic, multiple individual sensors, sensor fusion algorithms, programmability, etc. Your basic electronics textbook doesn\u0026rsquo;t really capture the complexity of setting up and working with even the most basic digital sensors, communicating with them, or reading them. Each of these complex sensors could be a chapter or more (their datasheets can be 50 pages!)\nMotors and Actuators Motor theory hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed, but driving electronics have. Furthermore, with the prevalence today of brushless motors in applications such as robots and drones, the complexities of driving brushless motors should be added. Also missing from many textbooks is how to integrate position sensing and drivers together within a motor controller. There are many exemplar chips and dev-boards today that do this out of the box, such as simpleFOC, openbldc, odrive, dynamixel, etc.\nLow and High-level Communication Communication is no longer separated from low-level electronics projects. In the past, you could design a circuit without necessarily needing to network it or communicate with the outside world, but when $2 microcontrollers these days include a WiFi module, you need to also prepare your reader for communicating with the world\nAn in-depth discussion of low-level protocols, such as SPI, I2C, EUSART, Onewire, I3C, I2S, as well as wiring standards (RS485, etc) would help the reader prepare for terminology they will encounter when selecting compatible parts. A discussion of high level wired and wireless standards, such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, TCP/IP, Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa, would also help the reader select the appropriate You should provide concrete examples from datasheets, and code / software for interacting in C, as well as how to find existing libraries for arduino and micropython.\nMicrocontrollers The whole world of microcontrollers has changed, with new companies, whole families of products, updated architectures, etc. Consider microcontrollers that can run MicroPython or similar, in addition to lower-level languages like C. This satisfies a similar goal: you want to move along quickly, without delving too deep into the guts of a particular architecture, since it is likely to change.\nArduino is still a great, introductory architecture, because it is dominant at the hobbyist level. However, whole books are written on or about Arduino microcontrollers, and depending on your audience, many high-schoolers have already seen these. Discuss all the things microcontrollers can now do: connect to the internet, run a web page, run full operating systems Discuss the many new ways microcontrollers can be programmed these days. Furthermore, small Single Board Computers (SBC\u0026rsquo;s) that run full PC operating systems (raspberry pi, beagle bone, jetson nano, NUCs) should at least be introduced. These are a dominant competitor to microcontrollers these days, because you can program them using all the same code that runs on Linux, accessing modern and better-maintained codebases, and then do even higher-level computing and communication. You can develop faster. For this, students should be aware of Linux, as well as the major software packages and libraries you would want to consider if going this route.\nLLMs, Generative AI, and NLP This is an active discussion with my colleagues \u0026ndash; how do you introduce and teach with these tools in the classroom? You could consider adding a short discussion of this, because the tools are already here, and engineering students or hobbyists should be prepared to use them. Examples could include:\nUsing a coding assistant to increase productivity \u0026ndash; we already use VSCode in my courses, thus adding co-pilot or similar might be useful. consider AI-based PCB design tools. There are a few out there already. Are they mature enough to use? The only caveat is that this section would be outdated quickly\u0026hellip;\n3D Printing This may seem out of place, but so many people design and build their own enclosures for electronics, housings for motors, etc, that it should be introduced at least. You could add some concrete examples for how to print parts that minimize complexity, take into account manufacturability, assembly, and minimize part counts. You could talk about how to simplify attachments with self-tapping screws, capture nuts, etc.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2025-06-05-reimagining-electronics-handbooks/","tags":null,"title":"Reimagining Today's Electronics Handbooks"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Intro I don’t know if it’s the ever-increasing volume of bad news I’m getting from my tech podcasts, the impending AI apocalypse, or perhaps myself atrophying a bit and sticking with what I know, but if I hadn’t already switched to Linux, the news that operating systems were baking in surveillance 1 certainly would have accelerated my shift. So I thought I’d discuss how I switched to Linux and why, but start with the tools I use to get things done in Linux, such as tools for writing, and how I de-linked myself from any one productivity suite.\nOffice / Productivity Let\u0026rsquo;s get one thing straight. I get distracted by editing tools. Instead of writing, I tweak, I bold, I fix my style sheets, I twiddle photos around. Thus, for me, markdown is a great alternative that keeps me focused. Why? Because markdown permits me to focus more on writing and less on presentation. For an academic, it\u0026rsquo;s similar to what latex is supposed to be like in theory, but in practice it gets me even closer. With the right tools, though, markdown is portable across different domains \u0026ndash; html, latex/pdf, docx, pptx \u0026ndash; I can use markdown as my base and output it to whatever I want.\nThere are a couple critical markdown tools that make this possible. The first is pandoc. Pandoc is a file converter that allows me to convert any document to any document type like powerpoint, pdf, latex, and markdown.\nI wrote a couple pieces of software to make using pandoc easier. First, I wrote a script in Visual Basic that extracts all the images and converts all my powerpoints to markdown, and allows me to unlink all my embedded videos. I have also created a package for applying pre-made templates for course syllabi, letters, and plain documents styled the way I like them, called pandoc-plus. It theoretically works across windows and linux, and I started this path much earlier than my switch to Linux.\nFor slides I use pandoc with the revealjs library to generate simple, styled html pages that click through just like a powerpoint file. I tweaked my pandoc-plus script for slides and put it in the same project.\nExtracting videos from my powerpoints was a tricky step; I have since collected all the previously embedded videos into a single folder and make a compressed copy of each one that I store locally on my machine. This permits me to take all my media with me, but retain the higher quality original in fewer places. I now just embed \u0026lt;video\u0026gt; elements in my markdown as needed. Critical to this step was a couple of command-line scripts added to cut and compress segments of videos for embedding into my powerpoints a little easier than FFMPEG alone. I grouped all these tools here, alongside tools for extracting images from pdf, generating image/video galleries, etc\u0026hellip;all in service of enhancing my ability to work with my own media outside of any one productivity suite.\nBut what about collaboration? I still use overleaf, google docs, libre office or office365 online when I need to. I also have a windows virtual machine with office loaded so I can ensure the formatting matches what I need it to catch the trickiest corner cases.\nWhat about CAD? I don\u0026rsquo;t use Solidworks or Autodesk Fusion360 daily, weekly, or monthly. If I did, it would be much harder. As it is, I just use them in a virtual machine as needed.\nYou make a lot of websites. How do you code those up? Again, I use markdown, with two strategies for generating static html. Why static site generators? Because I don\u0026rsquo;t need interactivity, and interactivity requires more from a hosting provider. Without host-side interactivity, I can use github to serve my html pages.\nFor cases where I want/need to control the styling or theme of the page completely, I use Hugo alongside heavily-edited themes I\u0026rsquo;ve found in the community. Hugo is much faster than Jekyll, a more-well-known alternative, which I used to use, and also, helps keep your content separate from your code. This is better for text portability across different domains, and the markdown requires little editing in the transition.\nAlternatively, I also am a big fan of mkdocs with the material theme. This is for cases, like classes, where I don\u0026rsquo;t care about the style as about the ease of managing the site. This approach has saved me weeks of time over Hugo\nWHY, WHY MARKDOWN? Because, at the end of my day, mixing text, images, and video together created an unmanageable mess that kept growing in scope and size. By linking images, video, and text back to their source, I have been able to move towards fewer files that I edit iteratively, and store the text in git repositories. Thus, I get the benefit of seeing the entire history of my files, without the reliance on the cloud or the bloat of keeping every old version of my files.\nWhat about the unmanageable mess of having file links decay and have to be maintained?\nWell, at least I can search across all my markdown files in a fraction of the time and fix links globally using simple find/replace.\nWhat editor do you use to write markdown in? VSCode with a number of additional extensions. Why? Because I can also use VSCode for Python, latex, Jupyter, and other text-based editing tasks. It\u0026rsquo;s a good-enough one stop shop. I really liked obsidian, too, but that would be better for me if I only was working with markdown.\nHow did you get your files out of the cloud? TL/DR: It was easy since google made me do it anyways2.\nI used Rclone to download and convert google docs to .docx, .pptx, and other office files. Then I used my ppt converter and/or pandoc-plus to do an initial pass at converting them to markdown.\nRclone is a great tool for syncing files across cloud providers. It\u0026rsquo;s great for syncing files locally at the command line, and it also has a \u0026ldquo;mount\u0026rdquo; option that permits it to behave like a new drive or mounted folder in your filesystem, as an alternative to using each cloud provider\u0026rsquo;s native app.\nConclusion This is an incredibly short summary of YEARS of development work that permitted me to extricate my own files and simplify my approach towards writing. While the tools I developed helped me, they are not written for you, and are not general purpose, with little documentation in some cases.\nIt would also have been better to start with this approach. Half of the tools I wrote were to facilitate a one-time conversion, and don\u0026rsquo;t really have a purpose in my day-to-day any more.\nARS Technica: New Windows AI feature records everything you’ve done on your PC\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Register: The end of free Google storage for education\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2024-05-22-incredible-feats-of-productivity/","tags":null,"title":"Incredible Feats of Productivity"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction If you like keeping all your computing in one language (and that language is Python), but want some of the equation manipulation capabilities of Mathematica, have you tried Sympy?\nUsing Sympy in Expressions The sympy package in Python is useful for forming and working with symbolic expressions rather than literals. A \u0026ldquo;literal\u0026rdquo;, in programming terms, is a numeric value, like 1.2. You can assign numeric, literal values to variables in Python natively, and use python expressions to find numeric answers to expressions. But what if you wanted to work with the expression or equation itself? This is where \u0026ldquo;symbolic\u0026rdquo; variables come in.\nTo explore this concept, first we should import the sympy package\nimport sympy To create a symbol, we instantiate sympy\u0026rsquo;s Symbol() class. It requires, at minimum, a string to define how the symbol will be reendered\na = sympy.Symbol(\u0026#39;a\u0026#39;) b = sympy.Symbol(\u0026#39;b\u0026#39;) To see how a is rendered in IPython or Jupyter, simply call the variable you stored the symbol in:\na $\\displaystyle a$\nYou can see that it is rendered, whenever possible, as a latex-style expression. This also means you can create symbolic variables that use the latex math mode\u0026rsquo;s expansive set of greek symbols. For example\ntheta1 = sympy.Symbol(\u0026#39;\\\\theta_1\u0026#39;) theta1 $\\displaystyle \\theta_{1}$\nHere we have created a symbol, stored in variable theta1, that renders as the greek letter $\\theta_1$.\nNote that we had to use a double backslash (\\\\), rather than latex\u0026rsquo;s single backslash. This is due to the fact that Python strings recognize single backslash characters as a flag for writing non-printing characters such as tab and carriage return. In fact, \\t renders in a Python string as a tab character. To get around this, Python strings use the double-backslash to indicate strings where a single backslash was desired.\nWith symbols created, we can now begin to form symbolic expressions.\nc = 5*a+3*b**2 c $\\displaystyle 5 a + 3 b^{2}$\nIn this case, we have stored the symbolid expression $5a+3b^2$ into a Python variable, c. In contrast, if we were working with numeric literal values, the result of a python expression are stored as a numeric value as well.\nd = 5.5 e = 6 f = d+e f 11.5 type(f) float When working with symbolic expressions, it is sometimes useful to list all the \u0026ldquo;atomic\u0026rdquo; values being used in the expression. This helps separate the operands from the operators. The atoms() method is useful for this:\nc.atoms() {2, 3, 5, a, b} However, what if we want to list only the symbolic variables, rather than the numeric? We can supply Symbol to atoms() to filter out the symbolic items\nc.atoms(sympy.Symbol) {a, b} We can work with systems of equations by forming expressions or symbolic variables into matrices or vectors. Sympy Matrix() classes are useful for that, but have some differences in the assumed structure of the vectors and matrices you form:\nd = 5*a+3*b-2 e = 6*a+2*b-5 f = sympy.Matrix([d,e]) f $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}5 a + 3 b - 2\\\\6 a + 2 b - 5\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nIn this case, we formed a 2x1, 2-dimensional matrix. Defined in this way, we can solve the system of equations all at once using sympy.solve().\nsolution = sympy.solve(f,(a,b)) solution {a: 11/8, b: -13/8} Though the answer supplied is numeric, it is important to note that these results are still in a sympy numeric format, hence the rational result rather than a decimal float.\nYou can also use sympy\u0026rsquo;s many tools for operating on expressions directly. Creating a well-known expression,\ng = 3*a+ 4*b +7*a+16*b-32*a*b We can see that the simplify method is a handy tool for shortening expressions, using a number of approaches under the hood.\ng.simplify() $\\displaystyle - 32 a b + 10 a + 20 b$\nOne of those tools is the expand() method, which can be used on its own.\ng = (a+b)*(a-b) g.expand() $\\displaystyle a^{2} - b^{2}$\nsimplify() also applies trigonometric simplifcations when appropriate:\nf = sympy.sin(theta1)**2 + sympy.cos(theta1)**2 f.simplify() $\\displaystyle 1$\ng = sympy.sin(a)*sympy.cos(b) + sympy.sin(b)*sympy.cos(a) g.simplify() $\\displaystyle \\sin{\\left(a + b \\right)}$\ng = sympy.cos(a)*sympy.cos(b) - sympy.sin(a)*sympy.sin(b) g.simplify() $\\displaystyle \\cos{\\left(a + b \\right)}$\nAs noted above, though, care must be taken when working on matrices and arrays between numpy and sympy. There are differences in the dimensions of structures created between these two packages. For example,\nimport numpy v1 = sympy.Matrix([1,2,3]) v2 = numpy.array([1,2,3]) v3 = numpy.array([[1,2,3]]) print(v1.shape,v2.shape,v3.shape) (3, 1) (3,) (1, 3) As you can see, sympy Matrix classes create 2-dimensional matrices with a length of 1 column when supplied by a list. Conversely, numpy arrays, when initialized, need to have the dimensions determined by the number of nested lists. Thus, converting sympy Matrix classes to numpy.array elements must be done with care, to ensure consistency.\nDerivatives You can take the partial derivative of expressions or matrices using the diff method.\nh = 1*a+2*b +3*a**2 +5*b**3 h.diff(a) $\\displaystyle 6 a + 1$\nw = sympy.Matrix([a,b,3]) w.diff(a) $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nFor nx1 matrices (vectors), the jacobian() method is also available, which finds the partial derivatives of a vector with respect to another vector of variables.\nw.jacobian(sympy.Matrix([a,b])) $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}1 \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 1 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nYou can substitute one thing for another using the subs() method. This is useful for evaluating an expression with numerical values\nexp = (a+b).subs({a:3, b:4}) exp $\\displaystyle 7$\nKeep in mind that even numerical results of sympy substitutions are sympy numbers and need to be converted to a different data type of a given precision. for example:\ntype(exp) sympy.core.numbers.Integer float(exp) 7.0 You can also use the subs method with matrices. This returns a matrix filled with sympy data types\nw_num = w.subs({a:5.5,b:3.2}) w_num $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}5.5\\\\3.2\\\\3\\end{matrix}\\right]$\ntype(w_num) sympy.matrices.dense.MutableDenseMatrix This can be converted into a numpy array, but again, take care to include the datatype in the array\u0026rsquo;s creation to ensure the contents are also converted to your desired data type\nresult = numpy.array(w_num,dtype=numpy.float64) result array([[5.5], [3.2], [3. ]]) ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2024-05-21-sympy-expressions/","tags":null,"title":"A Brief Intro to Symbolic Expressions in Python"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction The purpose of this tutorial is to show you the power of sympy for analyzing the math of linkages and kinematics. We will walk through a full example of solving for the motion of a four-bar linkage, with a variety of approaches explored along the way with an eye towards addressing sympy\u0026rsquo;s limitations, compared to other symbolic math environments like Mathematica, Maple, etc.\nFirst, import all your libraries. Note that we want to use the symbolic form of sin and cos a lot, so we intentionally import those functions into our main namespace. Likewise, we want to use the numeric value of pi often, so we can import that directly from the math package.\nimport sympy from sympy import sin,cos import math from math import pi import numpy import scipy import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import scipy.optimize as so You can create multiple symbols at a time, with latex formatting. if you want to use the backslash, however, remember that the backslash in Python is used for non-printing characters like \\n and \\t. Therefore, to \u0026ldquo;escape\u0026rdquo; that default, you have to use two backslashes. What would normally be \\theta in latex should be \\\\theta in a Python string.\nSeparate your separate symbols in the string with spaces or commas, and make sure each one has its own Python variable that it is saved to.\nqa,qb,qc,qd = sympy.symbols(\u0026#39;\\\\theta_a,\\\\theta_b,\\\\theta_c,\\\\theta_d\u0026#39;) la,lb,lc,ld = sympy.symbols(\u0026#39;l_a,l_b,l_c,l_d\u0026#39;) We can test what was produced to see how it formats in a Jupyter notebook. Pretty!\nqa $\\displaystyle \\theta_{a}$\nNext, we define a function to create rotation matrices with the rotation about the z axis. We are doing a planar example, so we only need a $R_z$ matrices. The function allows us to generate multiple rotation matrices, with different variables controlling the rotation amount, using the same code. Efficient!\ndef Rz(theta): Rz = sympy.Matrix([[cos(theta),-sin(theta),0],[sin(theta),cos(theta),0],[0,0,1]]) return Rz Ra = Rz(qa) Rb = Rz(qb) Rc = Rz(qc) Rd = Rz(qd) Ra $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}\\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; - \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 1\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nNext, create a Cartesian unit vector in the x direction. This is a generic unit vector variable that is not associated with any frame, so we can just call it x\nx = sympy.Matrix([1,0,0]) x $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\0\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s create a vector $\\vec{v}_1$, defined as the length of the A link, along the x-axis in the A frame. We need to transform it into the N frame (our base frame) in order to relate it to other vectors.\nv1_in_A = (la*x) v1_in_N = Ra*v1_in_A v1_in_N $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}l_{a} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)}\\\\l_{a} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)}\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nWe can use a dictionary to substitute numerical values for the symbolic variables. This is useful for plotting and solving specific problems\nv1_in_N.subs({qa:91*pi/180,la:1}) $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}-0.0174524064372835\\\\0.999847695156391\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nWe can now define the remaining vectors of the four-bar in the same way. $\\vec{v}_2$ is the distance along link B, from the end of link A. Its rotation is relative to the rotation of link A. Therefore, to express it in the N(base) frame, we need to express it first in terms of A, then N.\nv2_in_B = lb*x v2_in_A = Rb*v2_in_B v2_in_N = Ra*v2_in_A v2_in_N $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)}\\\\l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)}\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\n$\\vec{v}_3$ represents link C. It rotates relative to the base frame.\nv3_in_C = lc*x v3_in_N = Rc*v3_in_C v3_in_N $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\\\l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nLike link B, link D rotates relative to link C. $\\vec{v}_4$ represents link D, and it needs to be expressed first in C, and then in N, in order to relate it to other vectors\nv4_in_D = ld*x v4_in_C = Rd*v4_in_D v4_in_N = Rc*v4_in_C v4_in_N $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + l_{d} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)}\\\\l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\\\0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\n$\\vec{v}_1$,$\\vec{v}_2$,$\\vec{v}_3$, and $\\vec{v}_4$ are all relative vectors relating the positon of the end-effector of their links from their origin. To express their absolute position, we define $\\vec{p}_1$ - $\\vec{p}_4$ to express the absolute position of each joint in global space. The position of these points is all related to some origin point, $\\vec{o}$ which we also define.\no = sympy.Matrix([0,0,0]) p1 = o+v1_in_N p2 = o+p1+v2_in_N p3 = o+v3_in_N p4 = o+p3+v4_in_N Assembling each point permits us to plot the mechanism. We create a variable called points, which holds a list of each point in a particular order convenient for plotting (between each of the points listed, we want to draw a line).\npoints = sympy.Matrix([p2.T,p1.T,o.T,p3.T,p4.T]).T points $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}l_{a} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} - l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \u0026amp; l_{a} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \u0026amp; l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + l_{d} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)}\\\\l_{a} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} + l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; l_{a} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \u0026amp; l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\\\0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0 \u0026amp; 0\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nWe now want to plot the mechansim. We define two variables: design and state. Design is intended to hold all our \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;design\u0026rdquo; variables and you guessed it, state holds our \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; variables. Because we have, so far, a serial mechanism, all the rotations define the state of this open chain.\ndesign = {la:1.2,lb:.9,lc:1.1,ld:1.1} state = {qa:0*pi/180,qb:30*pi/180,qc:45*pi/180,qd:-30*pi/180} We substitute our design and state variables into points and plot the x and y coordinates\npoints_n = points.subs({**design,**state}) points_n = numpy.array(points_n,dtype = numpy.float64) plt.plot(*points_n[:2]) plt.axis(\u0026#39;equal\u0026#39;) (-0.09897114317029974, 2.0783940065762945, -0.053125920445898756, 1.1156443293638738) Solving closed loop constraints We would now like to use these expressions to solve for a valid configuration where the four-bar linkage is closed. This means that $\\vec{p}_2$ and $\\vec{p}_4$ are located at the same spot. In general, we can create a constraint equation that represents that condition, and then solve for our remaining free variables in order to find a valid configuration. First we define our expression:\n$$\\vec{p}_2=\\vec{p}_4$$\nThis useful for written math, but using sympy we need to eliminate the equals sign. Thus, we rewrite it as\n$$0=\\vec{p}_4-\\vec{p}_2$$\nand create a variable zero that holds this equation\u0026rsquo;s right hand side, truncating the trivial z-axis information:\nzero = p4-p2 zero = sympy.Matrix(zero[:2]) zero $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- l_{a} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} + l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + l_{d} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)}\\\\- l_{a} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} - l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{a} \\right)} + l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + l_{d} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nWe now need to define some other variables. First, we need to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; the base of the four-bar linkage. In the case of this four-bar, it makes sense to define the A link as fixed to the ground, with $\\theta_a=0$. Thus, we move qa into our list of \u0026ldquo;design\u0026rdquo; variables rather than state variables, since it never changes in our analysis\ndesign = {qa:0,**design} design {\\theta_a: 0, l_a: 1.2, l_b: 0.9, l_c: 1.1, l_d: 1.1} We now substitute our design variables into zero to create a specific case of our solution.\nzero_specific=zero.subs(design) zero_specific = sympy.Matrix(zero_specific) zero_specific $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} - 0.9 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 1.2\\\\- 0.9 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nhow many variables still exist in these equations? we can use the .atoms() method to find out\nzero_specific.atoms(sympy.Symbol) {\\theta_b, \\theta_c, \\theta_d} But we have only two nontrivial equations and three unknowns! How do we solve for all three? Well, this helps us understand how many degrees of freedom exist in this system. One of these variables is a free parameter (also known as an independent variable), which we can select. The other two are dependent variables, which are determined by the independent variable. Let\u0026rsquo;s supply our independent variable so that the remaining equations can be solved. Let\u0026rsquo;s pick $\\theta_b$\nindependent={qb:120*pi/180} zero_specific=zero_specific.subs(independent) zero_specific $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 0.75\\\\1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 0.779422863405995\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nNumerical Solving process We are first going to use a numerical approach to solving this problem, using the scipy.optimize package.\nWe now want to provide an initial guess for our two remaining dependent variables, $\\theta_c$ and $\\theta_d$, and a function that calculates the error of a guess for $\\theta_c$ and $\\theta_d$. We do this by supplying zero with a guess for $\\theta_c$ and $\\theta_d$, and computing the sum of squared error on the \u0026ldquo;residual\u0026rdquo;. Residual basically means the error between our computed answer and what it should be, 0.\nini = [45*math.pi/180,-45*math.pi/180] def myfun(guess): qc_guess,qd_guess = guess zero_guess = zero_specific.subs({qc:qc_guess,qd:qd_guess}) zero_guess_n = numpy.array(zero_guess,dtype = numpy.float64) sum_of_squared_error = ((zero_guess_n**2).sum())**.5 # print(guess,sum_of_squared_error) return sum_of_squared_error we now supply our guess and function to the scipy.optimize.minimize() function, which can be used to identify the guess for $\\theta_c$ and $\\theta_d$ that minimizes the error\nres = so.minimize(myfun,ini,method=\u0026#34;powell\u0026#34;) res message: Optimization terminated successfully. success: True status: 0 fun: 3.2518256220118898e-12 x: [ 1.861e+00 -2.114e+00] nit: 7 direc: [[ 0.000e+00 1.000e+00] [ 1.524e-01 -6.886e-02]] nfev: 297 Within the result we see a couple things. First, we see if the optimization process was successful. It says so. Second, we see res.fun, which indicates the magnitude of the residual error after our final guess, which is incredibly small. Finally, we see res.x, indicating the solution the solver found. We insert x into a dictionary\ndependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) and plot:\npoints_n = points.subs({**design,**independent,**dependent}) points_n = numpy.array(points_n,dtype = numpy.float64) plt.plot(*points_n[:2]) plt.axis(\u0026#39;equal\u0026#39;) (-0.390973836659514, 1.2757606588885482, -0.052693468583865546, 1.1065628402611765) But what if we want to find the solution using a different design, or different value for our independent variable? We need to generate a different function before solving. We can do this by wrapping function generation within another function.\ndef gen_fun(design,independent): zero_specific = zero.subs({**design,**independent}) zero_specific = sympy.Matrix(zero_specific[:2]) def fun(guess): qc_guess,qd_guess = guess zero_guess = zero_specific.subs({qc:qc_guess,qd:qd_guess}) zero_guess_n = numpy.array(zero_guess,dtype = numpy.float64) sum_of_squared_error = ((zero_guess_n**2).sum())**.5 # print(guess,sum_of_squared_error) return sum_of_squared_error return fun Let\u0026rsquo;s also make a function for plotting.\ndef plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent): points_n = points.subs({**design,**independent,**dependent}) points_n = numpy.array(points_n,dtype = numpy.float64) plt.plot(*points_n[:2]) plt.axis(\u0026#39;equal\u0026#39;) Now, we can supply different points and plot them\nini = [45*math.pi/180,-45*math.pi/180] independent = {qb:90*pi/180} myfun = gen_fun(design,independent) res = so.minimize(myfun,ini) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) independent = {qb:80*pi/180} myfun = gen_fun(design,independent) res = so.minimize(myfun,ini) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) independent = {qb:70*pi/180} myfun = gen_fun(design,independent) res = so.minimize(myfun,ini) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) The problem is that the solver can sometimes fail, or converge to an unexpected answer This can be for a couple reasons.\nYou supplied a bad initial guess There is no solution given the combination of design parameters and independent parameters you selected. For example:\nini = [45*math.pi/180,-45*math.pi/180] design = {qa:0,la:2,lb:1,lc:1,ld:1} independent = {qb:70*pi/180} myfun = gen_fun(design,independent) res = so.minimize(myfun,ini) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) ini = [45*math.pi/180,90*math.pi/180] design = {qa:0,la:1,lb:2,lc:2,ld:1} independent = {qb:120*pi/180} myfun = gen_fun(design,independent) res = so.minimize(myfun,ini) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) ini = [10*math.pi/180,60*math.pi/180] design = {qa:10*pi/180,la:1,lb:2,lc:1,ld:2} independent = {qb:60*pi/180} myfun = gen_fun(design,independent) res = so.minimize(myfun,ini) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],res.x)) plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) Symbolic Solving So how can we solve the symbolic expressions directly? Well we can use sympy.solve(). For example, we can take a specific design in a specific state, and solve for the remaining variables:\ndesign = {qa:0,la:1.2,lb:.9,lc:1.1,ld:1.1} independent = {qb:30*pi/180} zero_specific = zero.subs({**design,**independent}) zero_specific $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 1.97942286340599\\\\1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 0.45\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nsol = sympy.solve(zero_specific,(qc,qd)) sol [(-0.172242420242400, 0.791564062543542), (0.619321642301143, -0.791564062543542)] The solver was successfully able to identify the two potential solutions to the trigonometric problem:\ndependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],sol[0])) plt.figure() plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) dependent = dict(zip([qc,qd],sol[1])) plt.figure() plot_fourbar(design,independent,dependent) But we had already substituted all the other symbolic variables with numeric answers. What if we wanted to solve the generic problem as a function of qb?\ndesign = {qa:0,la:1.2,lb:.9,lc:1.1,ld:1.1} # zero = sympy.Matrix((p4-p2)[:2]) zero_specific = zero.subs(design) zero_specific $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}- 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} - 0.9 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 1.2\\\\- 0.9 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 1.1 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{d} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nIn this case we supplied all the design variables but did not include the independent parameter. The expressions don\u0026rsquo;t look too hard\u0026hellip;should we try solving?\nNO!\nUnfortunately, sympy is not able to solve this expression as a function of the independent variable in a reasonable time. This is both due to sympy\u0026rsquo;s limitations, and due to the fact that the nested trigonometric functions hide quite a bit of complexity. So don\u0026rsquo;t run the code below: generic_solution = sympy.solve(zero_specific,(qc,qd)) So now let\u0026rsquo;s try to simplify the expression by hand a little bit. First thing to recognize is that the coupler of our four-bar (link D) can be removed from the expression. Instead of saying that $\\vec{p}_4-\\vec{p}_2=0$, we could also say that $$|\\vec{p}_3 - \\vec{p}_2|=l_d$$ This permits us to remove $q_d$ entirely from the set of equations, simplifying our expression to $$(\\vec{p}_3 - \\vec{p}_2)\\cdot (\\vec{p}_3 - \\vec{p}_2) = l_d$$ in sympy,\ncoupler = p3-p2 zero2 = (coupler.T*coupler)[0]-ld**2 zero2 zero_specific = zero2.subs(design) zero_specific $\\displaystyle 1.21 \\left(- 0.818181818181818 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\right)^{2} + 1.44 \\left(- 0.75 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + 0.916666666666667 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 1\\right)^{2} - 1.21$\nNot too bad\u0026hellip;but again, the squares hide some complexity. What does it look like when we expand this expression?\nzero_specific = zero_specific.expand() zero_specific $\\displaystyle 0.81 \\sin^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 1.98 \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 1.21 \\sin^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 0.81 \\cos^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 1.98 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 2.16 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + 1.21 \\cos^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 2.64 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + 0.23$\nOof, getting longer. Let\u0026rsquo;s use the simplify expression to try to identify ways of eliminating redundancies, using trig identities to shorten the expression, etc.\nzero_specific = zero_specific.simplify() zero_specific $\\displaystyle 2.16 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2.64 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 1.98 \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} - \\theta_{c} \\right)} + 2.25$\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s much shorter, but is it short enough for sympy to solve with respect to $\\theta_b$? Unfortunately no. Don\u0026rsquo;t run the next command: generic_solution = sympy.solve(zero_specific,(qc))\nGeneral Solution Okay, so how to do this, while capturing all the variables of the design? We have to help sympy. First, let\u0026rsquo;s only supply the definition for $\\theta_a$ to our zero2 variable:\nzero_specific = zero2.subs({qa:0}) zero_specific $\\displaystyle - l_{d}^{2} + \\left(- l_{b} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\right)^{2} + \\left(- l_{a} - l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)}\\right)^{2}$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s expand to see how bad it is\u0026hellip;\nzero_specific = zero_specific.expand() zero_specific $\\displaystyle l_{a}^{2} + 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2 l_{a} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{b}^{2} \\sin^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b}^{2} \\cos^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{c}^{2} \\sin^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{c}^{2} \\cos^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - l_{d}^{2}$\nOuch. Let\u0026rsquo;s simplify:\nz2 = zero_specific.simplify() z2 $\\displaystyle l_{a}^{2} + 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2 l_{a} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{b}^{2} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} - \\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{c}^{2} - l_{d}^{2}$\nBetter. This helped find $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$ identities and eliminate them, as well as shorten trig expressions where possible. But our simplify did too much condensing, bringing $\\theta_b$ and $\\theta_c$ within a $cos()$ term. For our solver, this makes things harder again. Let\u0026rsquo;s expand back out:\nz3=sympy.expand_trig(z2).expand() z3 $\\displaystyle l_{a}^{2} + 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2 l_{a} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{b}^{2} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + l_{c}^{2} - l_{d}^{2}$\nNow the tricky part. We see in this expanded form that $\\theta_c$ comes either in the form of $\\sin(\\theta_c)$ and $\\cos(\\theta_c)$ terms. lets collect our expression around terms that contain those, or not.\nd = z3.collect((sin(qc),cos(qc)),evaluate=False) for key in d.keys(): print(key,\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;,d[key]) cos(\\theta_c) : -2*l_a*l_c - 2*l_b*l_c*cos(\\theta_b) sin(\\theta_c) : -2*l_b*l_c*sin(\\theta_b) 1 : l_a**2 + 2*l_a*l_b*cos(\\theta_b) + l_b**2 + l_c**2 - l_d**2 Using some advanced features of the collect function, we see that all the terms of the expression are either multiplied by $\\sin(\\theta_c)$ and $\\cos(\\theta_c)$ or $1$. Since we are trying to solve for $\\theta_c$, let\u0026rsquo;s substitute in simpler expressions for those coefficients.\nFirst we create 3 new symbols, for the 3 sets of coefficients we are replacing\nsymbol_strings = [\u0026#39;s_{}\u0026#39;.format(ii) for ii in range(len(d))] symbol_strings = \u0026#39;,\u0026#39;.join(symbol_strings) symbols = sympy.symbols(symbol_strings) symbols (s_0, s_1, s_2) We then create two new dictionaries. z4_subs1 is going to hold our replacement symbols for the three coefficients\nkeys = d.keys() z4_subs1 = dict(zip(keys,symbols)) z4_subs1 {cos(\\theta_c): s_0, sin(\\theta_c): s_1, 1: s_2} The second dictionary will replace the symbols with the original coefficients, once we have solved.\nz4_subs2 = dict(zip(symbols,[d[item] for item in keys])) z4_subs2 {s_0: -2*l_a*l_c - 2*l_b*l_c*cos(\\theta_b), s_1: -2*l_b*l_c*sin(\\theta_b), s_2: l_a**2 + 2*l_a*l_b*cos(\\theta_b) + l_b**2 + l_c**2 - l_d**2} We create expression z4, which is each key ($\\sin(\\theta_c)$, $\\cos(\\theta_c)$, $1$) times our new symbols\nz4 = [item*z4_subs1[item] for item in keys] z4 = sum(z4) z4 $\\displaystyle s_{0} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + s_{1} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{c} \\right)} + s_{2}$\nAah, finally simple enough to solve\nsol = sympy.solve(z4,qc) sol = sympy.Matrix(sol) sol $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}2 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(\\frac{s_{1} - \\sqrt{s_{0}^{2} + s_{1}^{2} - s_{2}^{2}}}{s_{0} - s_{2}} \\right)}\\\\2 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(\\frac{s_{1} + \\sqrt{s_{0}^{2} + s_{1}^{2} - s_{2}^{2}}}{s_{0} - s_{2}} \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nWe now replace s_0, s_1, and s_2 with their original contents:\nsol = sol.subs(z4_subs2) sol $\\displaystyle \\left[\\begin{matrix}2 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(\\frac{- 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - \\sqrt{4 l_{b}^{2} l_{c}^{2} \\sin^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + \\left(- 2 l_{a} l_{c} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)}\\right)^{2} - \\left(l_{a}^{2} + 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b}^{2} + l_{c}^{2} - l_{d}^{2}\\right)^{2}}}{- l_{a}^{2} - 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2 l_{a} l_{c} - l_{b}^{2} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - l_{c}^{2} + l_{d}^{2}} \\right)}\\\\2 \\operatorname{atan}{\\left(\\frac{- 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\sin{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + \\sqrt{4 l_{b}^{2} l_{c}^{2} \\sin^{2}{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + \\left(- 2 l_{a} l_{c} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)}\\right)^{2} - \\left(l_{a}^{2} + 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} + l_{b}^{2} + l_{c}^{2} - l_{d}^{2}\\right)^{2}}}{- l_{a}^{2} - 2 l_{a} l_{b} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - 2 l_{a} l_{c} - l_{b}^{2} - 2 l_{b} l_{c} \\cos{\\left(\\theta_{b} \\right)} - l_{c}^{2} + l_{d}^{2}} \\right)}\\end{matrix}\\right]$\nThis is finally a general solution to our coupler problem, but it takes a while to run the .subs() function within a loop. We can use the sympy.lambdify() function to turn this expression into a function, which is generally faster to evaluate. To do this we need to supply all the variables we need to replace in this expression to the lambdify function. We can use the atoms() function again to find them:\nvariables = list(sol[0].atoms(sympy.Symbol)) variables [\\theta_b, l_c, l_d, l_b, l_a] We then \u0026ldquo;lambdify\u0026rdquo; the solution:\nfc = sympy.lambdify(variables,sol) And now we can use it with a given design and state\ndesign = {qa:0,la:1,lb:1,lc:1,ld:.7} independent = {qb:120*pi/180} input = [{**design,**independent}[item] for item in variables] sol_n = fc(*input) sol_n array([[1.76233976], [0.33205534]]) There are two solutions. Substituting in the first solution for the answer to our dependent variable (qc), we can plot it. Note that we plot the coupler in red as its position is inferred from our solution, but not explicitly solved for.

There are a number of ways to install and manage packages \u0026ndash; pip, anaconda, virtual environments, poetry \u0026ndash; unfortunately, each code project has spent different amounts of effort tuning their install approach to suit one, maybe two of these paradigms. This means that the success of installing a complex python codebase depends heavily on the approach you took to install it, and it may or may not work. Anaconda, for example, which has been my tried-and-true approach to a uniform package management experience across operating systems for many years, has itself fallen victim to the increasing complexity of managing dependencies, or \u0026ldquo;dependency hell\u0026rdquo;.\nThis only gets harder as the connections between the operating system and programming language grow. As code projects start to depend on specific compiled binaries, environment flags, or specific network setups, the challenge of getting a working environment grows from a Python problem to a system problem. So, to support courses and to provide a uniform experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking into how to use containers for sharing working systems. There are a number of good reasons to use Docker, including:\nYou get the same experience everywhere A lot of the installation fuss is taken care of (by an expert) You can share a smaller image with the whole class that is pre-tested, or at least common. There are also some significant downsides to using it, including:\nTraditional GUI-based windowing systems are not supported out of the box. Web-based tools are much easier to integrate, though. dockerfiles are a black box. Unless they were intentionally shared and documented, you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know what the creator put inside. This can be a security issue, but in terms of education it obscures some of the learning. (This can be a good thing and a bad thing.) It also means you need to learn a little about docker, too! To mitigate some of these issues we can use interactive web apps like Jupyter that can facilitate interaction with containers. Docker\u0026rsquo;s compose file has also solved some of the configuration issues associated with running traditional docker images and containers, because you can put almost everything you need in a self-documented yaml file.\nFinally, while tools like Google Colab may use similar approaches to provide a jupyter front-end to python over the web, there is no guarantee that those tools are going to be available and free in the longer term. I thought it would be a good idea to see what the state of Jupyter over Docker is, to see if I can commonize the Python experience for students and take some of the installation guesswork out of the process, while enabling as much of the traditional python programming experience as I can.\nSo to provide a starting point, here is a tutorial for setting up a docker container complete with Python, a web-based interface, and some starter packages. This can be augmented from here with your own packages and then shared with others. But getting a working jupyter interface is a good starting point for the tutorial. I will share other containers based on this in the future.\nResources Using Python in a Docker Container ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2024-02-29-docker-python/","tags":null,"title":"Python and Jupyter in Containers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a way to provide access to ROS2 style data collection between computers, when specific kinds of access to the users\u0026rsquo; network is restricted.\nWhen I taught a new course in Spring 2023, titled \u0026ldquo;Experimentation and Deployment of Robotic Systems\u0026rdquo;, I was proficient in ROS, having deployed it in my own lab and used it in my PhD thesis a decade before, but I was not as familiar with the communication differences between ROS1 and ROS2. It turns out these differences are significant when deploying ROS2 to a network you don\u0026rsquo;t have control over.\nThis article helps find a way around these issues by using tailscale, a modern VPN implementation that uses wireguard under the hood for creating a flat, private, and efficient network between enrolled computers. This approach helps overcome the limitations created by the security requirements of physical hardware, as you might find in academic or industrial settings.\nBackground ROS1 is a well known quantity and has been deployed successfully in classrooms before. It is based on a custom messaging protocol built on top of TCP/IP, and requires a server PC to coordinate and relay messages through the network of other devices on the ROS network. As long as two computers are on the same network and can send TCP packets to each other, they can send messages to each other using ROS. It is also end of life, and not a good tool for teaching on in the classroom.\nThis ignores the finer points of ROS network design concepts and related issues, but it worked.\nWith the transition to ROS2, however, the underlying message transport system changed from a custom messaging protocol built on TCP to a standardized messaging interface (DDS) that allowed different vendors\u0026rsquo; messaging libraries to be used to supply specific DDS implementations. Two of the most popular, CycloneDDS and FastRTPS, which have both served as the default middleware for various versions of ROS2, use UDP instead of TCP out of the box. Furthermore, to eliminate the need for a \u0026ldquo;ROS Master\u0026rdquo; computer to coordinate communication, DDS implementations for ROS use UDP \u0026ldquo;Multicast\u0026rdquo; by default. UDP multicast can be thought of as a way to broadcast UDP packets to a network\u0026rsquo;s entire subnet. This helps simplify setup and lowers the barrier to entry for adding a new computer to ROS2 communication network, but it assumes that the user has control of their own network hardware and can enable UDP multicast. Unfortunately, school settings (as well as critical industrial networks), UDP multicast may be disabled by default.\nTL/DR: ROS2 didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me by default on my school network because\u0026hellip;security.\nInterview time You may be wondering, \u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you just bring your own router\u0026rdquo;?\nI did. But plugging it into the school network is a no-no. So then devices on my router wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have internet access. \u0026ldquo;What do you need internet access for?\u0026rdquo; Aren\u0026rsquo;t industrial networks supposed to be cut off from the internet? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ROS2 work without it?\nIdeally yes, but realistically no. Turning off internet access prevents devices subscribed to it from downloading new packages, software updates, and most importantly, connecting to services they expect to be there. In the case of the Turtlebot4 and the IRobot Create3 platform they are built on, this includes a custom, hardcoded NTP server used to set and synchronize time on the create3. \u0026ldquo;Why does the create3 need that?\u0026rdquo;\nComputers need their clocks to be synchronized sometimes. In the case of ROS2 and the create3 I believe the onboard clock might have been reset between hard resets. \u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you just download packages and updates and then switch to the disconnected private network once prepped?\u0026rdquo;\nEvery second in the classroom is precious. Spending 10 minutes getting computers switched over between networks eats into learning time. Furthermore, we were operating \u0026ldquo;headlessly\u0026rdquo;, meaning transitioning between wifi access points, already an error prone task, can render the device inaccessible if you type the SSID or wifi password in incorrectly. This would mean pulling out the SD card and finding a computer to fix the issue in at best, or having to reset the wifi connection manually (different for each device). This can kill a whole class period, even if only one or two students have pernicious issues. To the Solution Here is my solution\nVPN Options My solution involves setting everyone up on a VPN. There are open-source and subscription services that could work, but I was interested in finding a solution that:\nwas easy to set up for non experts supported a baked-in DNS-style solution so identifying computers on the network could be done by name rather than (potentially-ephemeral) IP address worked in the classroom and at home without re-configuration \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; to use if not FREE to use. ideally no reconfiguration required between home and school I have used a number of VPN technologies in the past, but many/most require\nCustom certificates or keys generated and distributed to them A host server you connect to (as a client) Custom routing instructions set up on each PC. I have used commercial VPNs in the past but these each needed some sort of server, which itself would need to be requistioned, set up, and networked. I am not an expert at that and there weren\u0026rsquo;t resources on campus for that. I had also used (raw) wireguard in the past using trailofbits\u0026rsquo; wireguard setup before, but the setup was error prone and required repeatedly recreating it if you needed to define new clients. There was also some weirdness in my routing setup, in that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get computers on the VPN to see each other across the network persistently. I knew I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the networking chops to identify corner cases and support a custom VPN solution for the semester. So I turned to tailscale.\nTailscale is a commercial solution built on top of wireguard that eliminates many of the hurdles associated with setup and configuration of a custom wireguard vpn. It is a commercial product but has a generous free tier, permitting up to 100 devices on a single tailscale network. It also supplies a service called \u0026ldquo;magic dns\u0026rdquo; that ties the computer\u0026rsquo;s hostname (that you define) to a custom dns entry connected back to that computer\u0026rsquo;s IP address. For example, if my computer\u0026rsquo;s hostname is \u0026ldquo;dans-dell-optiplex\u0026rdquo;, you could go to \u0026ldquo;http://dans-dell-optiplex/\u0026rdquo; and find any websites that computer is hosting. Handy!\nUnlike Windows, Mac, or Desktop Linux, server-based linux uses a hand-coded networking configuration called netplan. Most of the time, to force switching between wifi configurations, you need to modify the file, or switch between files. If you do it wrong in headless mode, you may have to connect to a keyboard and screen or pull out the SD card from your raspberry pi. I had suggested that students buy a cheap wifi access point for home and name it the same as the ASU wifi, so they could use their setup at home without switching wifi configurations. That is the only solution I had to the final need listed above. Any other good suggestions?\nI have also heard of Husarnet, which is built around ROS2 support. I was not familiar with this product and would have tried it next if my solution hadn\u0026rsquo;t worked.\n\u0026ldquo;But isn\u0026rsquo;t a VPN going to slow down communication?\u0026rdquo;\nYes, but think about the needs of a classroom vs industry. I need this solution to always work, without the delays associated with switching between home and school or between internal and external networks. We are not throughputting enormous amounts of data during most of the course. Additionally, my selection of tailscale is good because wireguard is reported to have some of the lowest latency due the network topologies it supports. DDS Implementation I had been using CycloneDDS on ROS2-galactic, as it was the default, but could not get it to work over my Tailscale network. I had previously gotten multicast support turned off in my CycloneDDS config for unicast-only communiation on a local network, and though I suspect my issues were simply my .xml configuration, the documentation provided no similar examples for my use case, and I saw no-one else doing it on the web. CycloneDDS also even purportedly supports TCP-based communiation, but again, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t put together a working xml file based on the documentation alone. Please let me know if you have working examples!\nI did find a solution on this site that uses FastRTPS instead. It was an easy switchover. FastRTPS is also supported by all the devices in my classroom, including:\nThe Turtlebot4 image supplied by Clearpath the IRobot Create3 (though I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet tested it) General linux virtual machines and docker images Implementations I have tried and tested this solution on the following devices:\nA Raspberry Pi Zero 2W running ROS2-humble, as my stand-in for the Raspberry Pi 4 modules in the turtlebot A Virtualbox Image Running ROS2-humble with bridged networking The default Ros2-humble image using host-mode networking A custom docker image running ROS2-humble. It should be noted that the host for these virtual machines is an Ubuntu machine. Some details about the virtualbox and docker solution may need to change for a Windows host.\nThe Solution I have created separate tutorials for the following implementations, which can all be found here:\nNotes about Tailscale setup It is important to enable \u0026ldquo;magic dns\u0026rdquo; in your tailscale administrative settings. This allows your computers to refer to each other by name rather than IP address. Another important tool for automating the creation of docker containers is the use of pre-defined authorization keys. These can be created and configured on tailscale as well.\nTesting In terms of testing, I am able to connect the raspberry pi to my home\u0026rsquo;s wifi access point and my computer to my phone\u0026rsquo;s wifi tethering, and it can send messages over the internet! There is significant latency and some message loss, but it works. When connected on the same physical network, the latency and loss are much lower. I still need to benchmark network speeds with it on vs over the bare network.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2024-01-25-ros2-over-vpn/","tags":["ros2","ubuntu","linux","tailscale","rpi","docker","tailscale","vpn"],"title":"Using ROS2 over VPNs in the Classroom"},{"categories":null,"contents":"I had the pleasure of teaching a new class called \u0026ldquo;Flexible Robotics\u0026rdquo; while on sabbatical at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey this Fall. The class was a 13 person, senior-level elective course that covered some of the same concepts as my graduate-level \u0026ldquo;Foldable Robotics\u0026rdquo; class that I have taught at ASU since 2016, but introduced about 75% new material, based on the needs of undergraduates in their senior year.\nThis course could not have been possible without the help and support of Onur Ozcan, who helped me get the course on the books in the first 24 hours I was in the country. The idea is that he will take on teaching responsibilities for this course at Bilkent in future years. His advice and guidance on getting the course set up in a different system than I am used to was critical. Thanks Onur!\nWhat is Flexbile Robotics? Flexible Robotics is a microcosm of some of the robotics research I do, and teaches a somewhat simplified version of the engineering approaches we use in my lab to design robots. It focuses on how to design robotic systems that are ultimately limited by the physics of the parts and materials they are constructed with. To find good designs, we have to know all about soft and flexible materials, motors and how they work, how to model non-ideal components using both first-principles and more realistic representations, and then the best practices for prototyping and validating the performance of our designs.\nFlexible Robotics is also a class taught on a budget. I am of the belief that anyone should have access to robotics concepts, and so I have designed this course to use off-the shelf parts and materials that almost anyone can obtain. I teach using open-source software tools such as Python, so that anyone can run the code we use on any platform. And I teach experiment design and data collection using more accessible approaches that I believe serve as a proxy for the modern robotics lab. Not all undergraduates have access to high-speed motion capture systems, but everyone has a cell-phone. Not every department has a universal testing machine sitting in the student lab, but anyone can make a (relatively) standardized weight. When we focus on the concepts of how to create good experiments, and the tradeoffs between approaches, the ultimate resolution of the tool matters less.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a summary of the high-level concepts baked into the course:\nI taught with a palette of low-cost parts and tools that are easily obtainable but didn\u0026rsquo;t sacrifice or simplify the associated engineering challenges. I provided interactive coding experiences built into class time using Jupyter Notebook and Python. I reinforced the kinematics content students should already have had (3D vector operations, rotation matrices, and quaternions), but from a different perspective. I added MuJoCo for teaching many concepts in the second half of the course in order to simplify and streamline the number of different tools students had to pick up. The course focused on how flexible and compliant materials impact the modeling and design process, and which representations of compliance work best for modeling. I used the concepts of biomechanics, specifically terrestrial locomotion, as a way to focus design goals, observe and measure behavior, and talk about performance. Course Highlights Below is a list of the things I focused on when developing this course.\nMuJoCo Team 3\u0026rsquo;s horse-inspired design\nFor the first time, I taught using MuJoCo as a design, modeling, and validation tool instead of my own Python dynamics package that I have previously taught with. I liked this shift because it made students more aware of the current challenges in simulation using a popular and powerful tool that is easier to learn than my own package. MuJoCo has much more thorough documentation, with more examples from the community, so I was not always \u0026ldquo;on call\u0026rdquo; supporting my own code. It also permitted the class to explore the role that contact and friction play at a deeper level than I had been able to take a class before. On the flip side, the tradeoffs of contact, friction, and \u0026ldquo;soft solvers\u0026rdquo; is complex and required more discussion than I gave it, without a satisfying or straightforward \u0026ldquo;answer\u0026rdquo; for how to apply it correctly.\nMechanisms and Kinematics In contrast to the graduate class I teach, the senior-level Flexible Robotics spends more time reinforcing fundamental concepts in vectors, kinematics, and transformations, but uses the framework of flexible, foldable, and compliant systems to teach from a different perspective. For example, we defined spherical parallel mechanisms using quaternions instead of rotation matrices or DH parameters, and used the fundamental properties of vectors to define closed-loop constraint equations that we then solved numerically. Other approaches are often important in foldable systems, where kinematics are often defined from flat-foldable sheets of material rather than from rigid serial chains, and require efficient representations for faster solutions.\nCompliant Materials It has been difficult introducing compliant material systems, even in the graduate level course I teach, without getting into some complex topics and not feeling like there is enough time to do the topic justice. In this course, we focused on a few basic concepts of compliant material systems, while leaving others just to discussion:\nComparison of 2-element pseudo-rigid-body model and 100-element representation\nLumped-parameter models for series and parallel springs and dampers: refreshing students on this concept permits them to think critically about the impact of making beams longer or shorter, wider or narrower. It is a useful mental tool, though for cantilever beams under high deformation, simple linear expressions are not the best approximation. These limitations are discussed. Nonlinear FEA in Solidworks: We run through an example of running a nonlinear FEA simulation in Solidworks for a beam under high deformation. We discuss the tradeoffs associated with nonlinear FEA and simulation time. Pseudo-rigid-body models for cantilever beams: The pseudo-rigid-body-model is a useful tool for engineered shapes in which deformation can be represented more simply (as bending) than for completely soft systems, where FEA is more appropriate. We compare the behavior of high-deformation cantilever beams modeled with 1,2, 10, 100 joints using MuJoCo and discuss how the optimizer and our error metric impact the parameter fitting process; students then see how the behavior matches against the real-world in a homework assignment, finding the stiffness and damping joint parameters for a selected material they will use in their project. The benefit of this approach is that it is completely compatible with our selected dynamics engine. The drawback is that you have have some existing knowledge or correctly assume the primary modes of deformation in order to select the right system model. What we don\u0026rsquo;t get into. We have to leave other topics to just a discussion; I hope to expand on these topics with more offline content.\nNonlinear material models. It would be nice to have a concrete example of where nonlinear stress/strain models help us estimate behavior. First-principles derivations: We don\u0026rsquo;t get into the theory of continuum mechanics, nor do we derive the elliptic curve equations that beams adopt under high deformation. It would be nice to have time to justify our use of lumped parameter models. Finite Element Theory: This would be the most useful topic for a general-purpose soft robotics course, and would go well in this class as well. Learning a new tool and integrating it with the dynamics of MuJoCo would be difficult. Perhaps a different simulator would be needed in order to implement this effectively in Flexible Robotics. I am open to suggestions! System Identification and Design Optimization Servo-fitting example written up previously\nI believe that in general, students need more experience collecting, analyzing, and working with real-world data within the engineering curriculum. I increased my focus on the use of optimization tools for the purposes of model fitting, parameter identification, and design optimization. In Flexible Robotics, students collected their own real-world data and fit the behavior they observed to the models they developed, primarily using cell-phones for video capture to enable optical motion-tracking. We used this approach to walk through a full characterization of an RC servo in class, the parameters of which the students could use in their models. Outside of class, students created their own experiments for measuring the stiffness and damping behaviour of compliant materials serving as the links and joints of their systems, measuring the mass and inertia of their links, and capturing the friction of the surfaces they tested their robots on. I primarily taught using the scipy.optimize package, which has a number of fundamental optimization algorithms available in the scipy.optimize.minimize() function.\nResearch Integration I was lucky enough to join Onur\u0026rsquo;s lab meetings and help contribute to some ongoing research with his students. Two of Onur\u0026rsquo;s students presented their research to the class. I believe it was valuable for students to see how graduate researchers are using the same tools and approaches to solving research problems \u0026ldquo;in real life\u0026rdquo; from someone other than the professor. We talked through their current design challenge, some of their design and optimization goals, and they discussed the details of their modeling choices.\nParts and Materials We settled on a list of parts readily available in Turkey. The cost per student was ~$15. Students who wanted to keep their parts at the end of the semester sourced them themselves; otherwise we loaned sets of parts to students who needed them. Most students\nItems units Lira/unit Subtotal Subtotal ($) Micro Servo 1 37.1 37.1 1.37 Breadboarding wire bundle 1 49 49 1.81 5V Power Supply 1 139 139 5.15 Electrolytic Capacitor, 4700uF 1 10.23 10.23 0.38 6’ USB A to micro cable 1 30.01 30.01 1.11 ESP32 1 123.69 123.69 4.58 Photoresistor 2 2.73 5.46 0.2 Half-size breadboard 1 66 66 2.44 Resistor matched to photoresistor 2 0 0 0 Total 394.49 14.61 In terms of materials, the Bilkent bookstore was a good source for acetate sheets, which served as a good flexible material that is cheap and easy to work with. Various kinds of cardboard and posterboard were also available to create rigid elements.\nCourse Projects There were two course projects. The first project focused on the kinematics and force/torque analysis of a proposed rigid subsystem like a leg, while the second project added compliant material considerations, experiment design and data collection, dynamic modeling, and design optimization at a system level. Teams of ~4 students contributed their individual kit of parts, so were capable of creating quite complex robots.\nI insisted during the second project in meeting with each team to help them focus and trim down the scope of their project. The timing of this meeting was critical, and I saw dramatic improvements in simulation quality and experimental results. The project writeups actually seemed more complete because teams were able to more thorougly explore fewer goals.\nTwo final project designs, simulated in MuJoCo\nExams To satisfy University requirements, I added a midterm and final exam to the course. Typically I have lumped more points into assignments and projects, but this helped get the course accepted by the provost on the first pass. It also required that I spend more class time focusing on fundamentals, but in the end I believe this was time well spent.\nReflections Below are a short list of things I might do differently or improve upon in future iterations of the course.\nKinematics In terms of solving closed-loop kinematics, estimating forces and torques, and solving the forward or inverse solution to the motion paths created by a mechanism, I provided multiple pathways:\nSolving for the configuration of a rigid mechanism (a triangle) using vector operations like length constraints to find the triangle that satisfied a prescribed set of edge lengths. An extension of this toward a four-bar linkage, with numerical Jacobian calculations. An example of determining a Jacobian symbolically using the sympy package. A homework example that asked students to represent spherical kinematics using quaternions and constraints using vector operations. However, the variety of examples and approaches seemed to confuse students rather than clarify the concepts of kinematics. In the future, I think more offline examples of each would help. Focusing on one or two \u0026ldquo;preferred\u0026rdquo; approaches might eliminate some of the confusion, but I also worry this would prevent students from knowing which approaches to select in a different context.\nMore Introductory Concepts on the Computational Side I introduced the mechanics of using MuJoCo before explaining how modern simulators work or some of the many tradeoffs each one makes in its design. This meant that students only started understanding these tradeoffs later in the semester as they began encountering issues with contact and friction. That can be ok, but some of the feedback I heard from students was that they would have liked to learn more how simulation works first. I think this would be a valuable addition.\nThe same can be said for the topic of optimization. Though it is a gigantic topic, more could have been discussed in class about the types of optimization categories there are, some of the most popular algorithms in each category, and the tradeoffs and considerations you need to employ in selecting one. I believe this would have been valuable, especially with more time in the semester. However, optimization approaches change quickly, and is likely to already be stale if I am teaching it. I believe it is within an engineer\u0026rsquo;s domain to know how to pick, design, and implement a good approach to solving a given problem, but I believe that in this class that knowledge should be general rather than specific, so that students can adapt what they learn to whatever the popular approach of the day is in the future.\nThat being said, I think one lecture devoted to optimizing with reinforcement learning or neural networks vs fmin() would be a valuable addition.\nPrototyping vs Manufacturing Based on the availability of the tools and my limited familiarity with the school\u0026rsquo;s facilities, Flexible Robotics focused more on manual prototyping approaches than digital manufacturing techniques supported by computational planning approaches. While it would have been nice to devote more time to this topic, other things took more priority. By the end of the course, I was cutting material, and it made more sense to remove this module than to take time away from more fundamental concepts.\nIn-class coding In previous classes I have taught, I have used time in class to explain code as the students and I write code together. Students ask questions as they follow me, and I help them avoid common coding pitfalls by walking through a working example in detail. I often share the code produced during the lecture afterwards.\nI believe this style of lecture worked less well this year than in previous years, partially because I shared the code. I usually do this because not all students can type or follow and get stuck while most of the class is waiting for the next step. This can make some students frustrated and others bored, and kill the flow of the class. It has been better in the past to subsequently post the code so I can keep moving. But I observed this year that that most students stopped coding the examples along with me in class and simply ran the code later. This made the lectures infinitely less interesting, meant that I was talking more, and was more boring for students while also less useful because they were not solving problems, live, with me.\nI found a solution later in the semester that I hope to implement in future iterations. I had one student volunteer come up and code in front of the class. I stated the \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026rdquo; for the day and they tried to code it up with help from their classmates (and much support from me too.) I did not share this code later (because it wasn\u0026rsquo;t mine to share), but instead had everyone submit their version of the code for homework credit.\nResults Below are some pictures and videos from the final presentations in the last lecture. I was proud of the students\u0026rsquo; progress, and though not every robot performed as well as the students would have wanted, the students themselves displayed a thorough command of their work.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2024-01-04-class-wrapup/","tags":null,"title":"Wrapping up \"Flexible Robotics\""},{"categories":null,"contents":" This browser does not support the video tag. Introduction In the last article I took some data from a small, off-the-shelf servo, the SG90, 9 gram micro-servo. In this article, I continue with modeling and parameter fitting. This work was done to prepare for the class I developed, called Flexible Robotics. This is an undergraduate course with a focus on mechanism design and kinematics, experimentation, prototyping, parameter ID and design optimization. I introduced the python interface to MuJoCo as our tool of choice for modeling and simulation in the second half of the course, as it is both relativly easy to pick up and it motivates many interesting discussions about contact, compliance, and modeling decisions. So this article focuses on how to model the servo using MuJoCo.\nSteps Part 5: MuJoCo-based model This step involves developing a MuJoCo model matching the experimental setup, and using it in conjunction with the collected data in identifying the remaining unknown parameters.\nFirst we import required packages and modules\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy import math import yaml import mujoco import numpy import mediapy as media Since this is a separate ipython notebook, I am repeating some of my previous work (shame!). I define a square-wave function for emulating the control signal sent to the pwm model.\ndef square(t,A,f,w,b,t_0): y = (t-t_0)*f y = y%1 y = (y\u0026lt;w)*1 y = A*y +b return y Motor Modeling This is where there is some guesswork involved. I pored over a number of datasheets (linked below) to identify common parameters across many different manufacturers. I know that the SG90 may not share the same innards across manufacturers, and in the past I\u0026rsquo;ve even confirmed how different these devices behave. But I was without an oscilloscope, current meter, etc.\nMost of the performance data was taken at the SG90\u0026rsquo;s nominal 6 volts. This is important for obtaining the correctly scaled motor constants. Manufacturers listed a range of stall torques, but many were around the 15 N-cm range (or .15 N-m). One data sheet actually identified the gear ratio from the SG90\u0026rsquo;s gear train as 55.5. This means we can find the motor\u0026rsquo;s stall torque, using $t_{motor} = \\frac{t_{output}}{G}$. Additionally, many manufacturers listed the \u0026ldquo;max\u0026rdquo; current to be around 550, 600, or 650 mA. I took this to mean \u0026ldquo;stall current\u0026rdquo;, and used 600 mA. From here we can identify the motor\u0026rsquo;s resistance with $V_{nom}/i_{stall}=R$.\nWith stall torque and stall current we can also identify the motor\u0026rsquo;s $k_t$, or torque constant, using $k_t=\\frac{t_{stall}}{i_{stall}}$. This number should be the same as the motor\u0026rsquo;s back-emf constant, or $k_e$. The motor\u0026rsquo;s speed constant, $k_v$, should be a little different, and can be determined by finding $k_v=\\frac{V_{nom}}{\\omega_{NL}}$, where $\\omega_{NL}$ is the motor\u0026rsquo;s no-load speed. In one data sheet I found the max speed of the servo to be .66 degrees per millisecond. Using this we can calculate the motor\u0026rsquo;s no-load speed to be\n$$w_{NL} = G \\frac{.66\\text{ deg}}{\\text{ ms}}\\frac{1000 \\text{ms}}{\\text{s}} \\frac{\\pi \\text{ rad}}{180\\text{ deg}}$$\nThese two numbers are different because $k_v$ also captures any internal mechanical losses experience by the motor, which can be lumped into a damping term $b = \\frac{k_t i_{NL}}{\\omega_{NL}}$, where $i_{NL}$ is the no-load current of the servo, which I assume is mostly consumed by the motor. The derivation for this is relatively straightforward, but I won\u0026rsquo;t do it here. (I teach this in my class though).\nVnom = 6 G = 55.5 t_stall = 15/100/G i_stall = .6 R = Vnom/i_stall i_nl = .2 w_nl = .66*1000*math.pi/180*G kt = t_stall/ i_stall # kv= Vnom/w_nl ke = kt b = kt*i_nl/w_nl ts = 1e-4 I load the sanitized experimental data saved from the last article.\nwith open(\u0026#39;servo_data_collection.yml\u0026#39;) as f: servo_data = yaml.load(f,Loader=yaml.Loader) I convert it to a numpy array and check the shape\nt_data = numpy.array(servo_data[\u0026#39;t\u0026#39;]) t_data.shape (214,) Next, I determine the timestep of the data. This obviously just comes from the video, but I want to ensure that my mujoco data is saved at the same rate or else I will have to interpolate, decimate, or otherwise match disparate-timed events.\ndt_data = (t_data[-1]-t_data[0])/len(t_data) I convert the theta data to a compatible numpy array and check the shape. This will need to match mujoco\u0026rsquo;s simulated data.\nq_data = numpy.array([servo_data[\u0026#39;theta_u\u0026#39;]]).T q_data.shape (214, 1) I define the desired control signal (for plotting purposes).

This consists of the following decisions:\nI make my timestep a template variable so I can adjust it in python without modifying the text. my body consists of a cylinder whose size and mass matches the battery\u0026rsquo;s dimensions. It is centered around a revolute joint in the x axis. There is no information given about the motor\u0026rsquo;s own inertia, so I am going to ignore its effect and assume that the battery\u0026rsquo;s inertia dominates the motion. In class, we talk about the magnification of inertia through gearheads, but we will ignore it here. I added a small cylinder on one side just for visualizing the battery better. I include one actuator of type motor, located at joint_1. This will be controlled using a controller callback function I define later. render_width = 800 render_height = 600 xml_template = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026lt;mujoco\u0026gt; \u0026lt;visual\u0026gt;\u0026lt;global offwidth=\u0026#34;{render_width}\u0026#34; offheight=\u0026#34;{render_height}\u0026#34; /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/visual\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option timestep=\u0026#34;{ts}\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;worldbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;light name=\u0026#34;top\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 10\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body name=\u0026#34;body_1\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; axisangle=\u0026#34;1 0 0 0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;joint name=\u0026#34;joint_1\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;hinge\u0026#34; axis=\u0026#34;1 0 0\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;cylinder\u0026#34; size=\u0026#34;.00725 .024\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;0 1 1 1\u0026#34; mass=\u0026#34;.016\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;cylinder\u0026#34; size=\u0026#34;.0025 .0025\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 .024\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;0 1 1 1\u0026#34; mass=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/worldbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;actuator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;motor name=\u0026#34;motor_1\u0026#34; joint=\u0026#34;joint_1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/actuator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/mujoco\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; I format my template with my one variable, ts, to create my xml string\nxml = xml_template.format(ts = ts, render_width = render_width, render_height = render_width) I create my model, data and renderer and a function that runs the model, changing the kp and b values as needed.\nmodel = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string(xml) data = mujoco.MjData(model) renderer = mujoco.Renderer(model,width=render_width,height=render_height) duration = t_data[-1] # (seconds) framerate = 30 # (Hz) data_rate = 1/dt_data print(duration,data_rate) 7.122644 30.04502260677355 I next create a function that generates a controller callback function and runs the simulation, returning the time vector and position vector for joint_1.\nThe controller function I define, applies proportional control to the error between where the servo is commanded and where it is, and then converts that voltage command into the torque applied to the simulation.

I am assuming that inside the servo there is an h-bridge of some sort, that can control the voltage across the motor leads within close to the V_supply range.\nI am using V_supply=5 instead of $V_{nom}$ from the equations above because my experiment was run at 5V rather than the datasheet\u0026rsquo;s assumed 6V.\ncomputes the torque as a function of the motor parameters determined earlier, along with a new value, $b_{act}$ that represents any additional losses not correctly identified earlier.

This gear ratio means that our servo hits its maximum velocity pretty quickly. This is often thought of as the servo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;slew rate\u0026rdquo;. It is mostly a function of the gear ratio, the internal mechanical loss, back-emf constants, and driving voltage. Even if the guess for $k_e$ is too large, the internal damping lumped into $b$ can be increased to match what we see at the output. And just because we made a guess for $V_{supply}=5$, this will be wrong too, because the transistors driving the current across the motor\u0026rsquo;s coils will have a small voltage drop. Each of these unknowns serves to change the slope of the line; so we just have to pick one free variable to lump all these unknowns into. For this exercise I pick b, setting everything else to my educated guesswork from the datasheets, as discussed above.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s talk about $k_p$. Our servo is at its maximum speed throughout most of its motion, meaning that our controller is saturated. So where does $k_p$ play a role in the shape of our output? If you think about it, the controller is only unsaturated at the \u0026ldquo;knee\u0026rdquo; of the step function, near the corners, where the speed begins to finally drop as the error gets closer to zero. The magnitude of $k_p$ will thus only determine the sharpness of the corners of the step function.\nLets try a couple different values to see what I mean. Changing $k_p$ values results in a sharp or rounded transition near the corners of my actuator\u0026rsquo;s step response.\nt,q1 = run_sim(kp = 2,b_act = b,render=False) t,q2 = run_sim(kp = 4,b_act = b,render=False) t,q3 = run_sim(kp = 20,b_act = b,render=False) a1 = plt.plot(t_data,q1) a2 = plt.plot(t_data,q2) a3 = plt.plot(t_data,q3) plt.legend(a1+a2+a3,[\u0026#39;$k_p=2$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$k_p=4$\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;$k_p=20$\u0026#39;]) plt.show() Comparing different values of $k_p$\nLikewise, changing the damping value mostly impacts the slope.\nt,q1 = run_sim(kp = 20,b_act = b,render=False) t,q2 = run_sim(kp = 20,b_act = b*3,render=False) t,q3 = run_sim(kp = 20,b_act = b*6,render=False) a1 = plt.plot(t_data,q1) a2 = plt.plot(t_data,q2) a3 = plt.plot(t_data,q3) plt.legend(a1+a2+a3,[\u0026#39;$b={b:1.2e}$\u0026#39;.format(b=b),\u0026#39;$b={b:1.2e}$\u0026#39;.format(b=b*3),\u0026#39;$b={b:1.2e}$\u0026#39;.format(b=b*6)]) plt.show() Comparing different values of $b$\nPart 6: Parameter identification So let\u0026rsquo;s find the best values for $k_p$ and $b$. I import scipy.optimize and define a function that will be called by the minimize function. It runs the simulation and compares the simulation data against the experimental data, finds the error, and returns the sum of squared error over time.\nimport scipy.optimize as so def fun(vars): k,b = vars t,q = run_sim(k,b) error = q-q_data error = error**2 error = error.sum() error = error**.5 print(k,b,error) return error test it with an initial guess.

Keep in mind, the values I found will probably stray a bit if you use the servo at a different supply voltages. But the fit I was able to achieve seems pretty good for estimating servo performance going forward. This model is not good for estimating the electrical efficiency, though, because our guesses for $k_e$ were not really validated or measured, and the true internal losses are not known. Without a power meter on the electrical side, I won\u0026rsquo;t be able to understand how much electrical energy it takes to achieve the motion I observed.\nFor the purposes of understanding the ability of our motors to generate mechanical power, though this model works.\nExternal References I used the following resources in the last two articles\nhttps://www.princeton.edu/~mae412/TEXT/NTRAK2002/292-302.pdf https://www.auselectronicsdirect.com.au/assets/brochures/TA0132.pdf https://components101.com/sites/default/files/component_datasheet/SG90%20Servo%20Motor%20Datasheet.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353754375 https://www.kjell.com/globalassets/mediaassets/701916_87897_datasheet_en.pdf?ref=4287817A7A https://www.mpja.com/download/31002md%20data.pdf http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2023-12-07-servo-fitting/","tags":null,"title":"Micro Servo Data Collection, Parameter Identification, and Modeling: Parts 5 and 6"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction Finding good information on low-cost servos is difficult. In the next articles, I will describe my informal journey finding and identifying the motor parameters for a SG90 9-gram servo motor. These motors are ubiquitous at the low end of robotics parts, and are thus quite attractive for making affordable robots in the classroom. The quality of these motors varies widely, however, and little information has been collected on them in one place. Different manufacturers often give only some specifications.\nSo here is my attempt at modeling an SG90 servo using as much information as I could find on the web, plus a little elbow grease to put it all together.\nParts I used only tools I would imagine a resourceful citizen scientist would have, including:\nA cell phone for capturing video A selfie-stick tripod and mount for attaching my cell phone (you can use a chair, books, tape, etc to rig up your own mount if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one.) A single SG-90 servo. A single AA battery for some added inertia Wire to physically attach the battery A breadboard An ESP32 for sending position commands Other tools that would have greatly helped include a multimeter with current sensing and USB data output, oscilloscope, or current sensor. These tools would have let me measure current usage over time, including at startup/stall and in no-load conditions. Without this tool, I had to rely on manufacturers\u0026rsquo; data sheets and my own memory of prior tests.\nSoftware I already have my computer set up with the following tools\nVSCode for interacting with the ESP32 and micropython An ESP32 flashed with micropython An anaconda distribution with mujoco and jupyter lab installed Procedure Note: In case you don\u0026rsquo;t have the parts on hand you can still follow along with the data. The tracker project file (with video) is linked here and the .csv output can be found here\nPart 1: The Experiment I flashed micropython onto the ESP32 and crafted a simple program to alternate the servo 180 degrees every 2 seconds. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into detail on this step here, but feel free to poke around my website for other resources on ESP32, micropython, and servos. The code looked like this:\nfrom machine import Pin, PWM from time import sleep frequency = 50 range_low = 28 range_high = 122 servo1 = PWM(Pin(14),frequency) while(True): servo1.duty(range_low) sleep(1) servo1.duty(range_high) sleep(1) I then plugged in my ESP32 to a half-size breadboard and wired up my servo. I hung the end of the servo off the edge of a desk and weighted it down so it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t move.\nI wrapped a wire around my AA battery to rigidly attach it to the servo\u0026rsquo;s horn. I mounted the battery so it was mounted symmetrically about the rotational center of the servo.\nMy Inertial Load\nI weighed my battery for use later\nWeighing my mass\nI used a small tripod to hold my cell phone approximately 12 inches away from my scene. I made sure my servo was in the center of my frame, that my camera was perpendicular to the plane of my experiment, and that my zoom was such that I was not using the \u0026ldquo;fish-eye\u0026rdquo; lens of my camera\u0026hellip;in the case of a google pixel 6a, anything less than 1x uses the fish-eye lens that exhibits more warping around the edges. I did not bother to zoom in much, though, since I am not sure where digital zoom takes over. (Digital zoom doesn\u0026rsquo;t add any more information to the experiment, and can result in a worse image due to the extra image processing performed by the camera.)\nThe camera mount\nNote 1: It is important that your scene is as centered as possible in your image, and that the plane of motion is as perpendicular as possible to your camera lens\u0026rsquo;s radial axis. This will minimize the amount of warping seen in your image.\nNote 2: It should be noted that this is an informal approach to optical tracking. Camera calibration and knowledge of how lens distortion works should be utilized at this step when adapting my approach to a lab setting, but again, this article is focused on \u0026ldquo;good-enough\u0026rdquo; citizen science techniques, or techniques you can actually apply in a single, 75-minute class.\nI took several practice videos and checked them to ensure the camera didn\u0026rsquo;t move, the base of the servo didn\u0026rsquo;t shake or move, and that my scene was well-lit and in focus.\nThe servo stopped; no blur visible\nThe servo moving; it is still relatively easy to identify key points\nPart 2: Image tracking Tracker Screenshot\nI installed tracker on a Windows computer and imported my video. I identified several high-contrast points that remained visible even during the blurry bits when the servo was rotating. Tracker has the ability to follow marked points forward in time once you mark them. It follows the key point for as many frames as it can. I would call this a semi-automatic process. In my case, I found tracker\u0026rsquo;s tools to be only moderately helpful as the quality of my video was so low. But I was able to manually find most points tracker couldn\u0026rsquo;t; tracker filled in the gaps when the servo was not moving.\nI have a full tutorial on tracker associated with my foldable robotics class. Please see that for more information (as well as more tips on scene setup). A couple tips here though:\nI used the edge of the desk as my x-axis reference line, to ensure the x-y coordinate system matched up with a planar model with gravity in the -y direction. I output the data as a .csv file. Opening the file, I removed the two excess lines above the column labels. the Pandas package in python expects only one row above data, for heading labels. Once done, I saved the file to the same file name.\nPart 3: Massaging the Data In this part, lets summarize the information we have and the information we need. First, we have a given orientation of our recorded image frames because we captured the (supposedly) horizontal level of the desk. It would have been better to verify the level of the desk\u0026hellip;but it is what it is. We have two tracked points. We don\u0026rsquo;t have the location of the servo relative to those points, and we don\u0026rsquo;t specifically have the center of rotation. That will be the first issue. We also don\u0026rsquo;t exactly know the mass distribution of the battery as it was actually attached to the servo, but for this experiment we will assume we did a good job at centering it. A potential improvement on the last step would be to measure the distance to the battery\u0026rsquo;s boundaries at specific points in time to confirm it was roughly centered around the servo\u0026rsquo;s rotational axis. We can go back and add that later to the tracker project if we feel we need more precision.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s talk about what we need. Do we need the position of the servo? no. Do we need the position of particular points of the battery? No.\nAll we really want to know is how fast does the servo accelerate with an extra inertia attached to its output.\nAll other data can be obtained through electrical experiments, off the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s data sheet, or through first principles equations. So let\u0026rsquo;s work on converting our captured data points into an angular measurement, $\\theta$, that we can then compare to a dynamic model.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s import some necessary packages in python\u0026hellip;\nimport pandas import scipy.signal as ss import scipy.optimize as so import numpy import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import math Next, we import data collected by tracker and identify the useful columns\nReminder: You will need to open the .csv file to remove the first two rows. Pandas expects just one row for column names above the data\ndata = pandas.read_csv(\u0026#39;data.csv\u0026#39;) data.columns Index(['t', 'x', 'y', 'x.1', 'y.1'], dtype='object') Extract the time and position data of our markers\nt = data[\u0026#39;t\u0026#39;] Challenge: Finding the center of rotation The issue with my simple experiment was that it was quite hard to mark or estimate the center of rotation prior to the experiment. Now that I have video data, though, I can make an estimate abou the center of rotation by using the tracking data obtained from my marked points. In the next few chunks of code you\u0026rsquo;ll see how I went about identifying the best guess for the center of rotation.\nFirst, make a guess for the center of rotation by finding the mean of all the x and y data of our first point. This is rough but it should be close enough for an optimizer to do the rest\nxini = data[\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;].mean() yini = data[\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;].mean() ini = numpy.array([xini,yini]) print(ini) [2.55072079 0.21735663] Next, create a function that finds the sum of squared radii given an x,y coordinate guess for the center of rotation, across the two points tracked. By obtaining the distance from the guessed center to each point over all the data, the true center should minimize the sum of all distances to all tracked points.\ndef fun(guess): # break out guess into two variables, x0 and y0 x0,y0 = guess # start with zero error error = 0 # sum the squared length to point 1 over all time and add to error error += ((data[\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;]-x0)**2+(data[\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;]-y0)**2).sum() # sum the squared length to point 2 over all time and add to error error += ((data[\u0026#39;x.1\u0026#39;]-x0)**2+(data[\u0026#39;y.1\u0026#39;]-y0)**2).sum() # take the square root error = error**.5 # return the error return error The function, evaluated at the initial guess should provide a baseline error that can go lower still\nprint(fun(ini)) 18.010570547148244 Run the minimization and check the result\nresult = so.minimize(fun,ini) result message: Optimization terminated successfully. success: True status: 0 fun: 17.655446173747816 x: [ 2.719e+00 2.522e-01] nit: 4 jac: [-7.153e-07 0.000e+00] hess_inv: [[ 8.129e-02 -1.918e-01] [-1.918e-01 9.600e-01]] nfev: 21 njev: 7 Compute the vectors from the origin to the two tracked points.

Why? The issue is that the theta value recovered \u0026ldquo;jumps\u0026rdquo; when it exceeds $|\\pi|$. We can further work with the data to \u0026ldquo;unwrap this value. Any value that jumps more than $\\pi$ between individual timesteps by the arctan2 function can be interpreted to actually be continuously increasing (or decreasing) past that value. We just need to keep track of how many times from the beginning of our data we have crossed this threshold, and add it to our original measurement. Thus, we have the unwrap() function.\nNote: Scipy / Numpy has an unwrap function but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to work for me\u0026hellip;thus, I wrote my own.\ndef unwrap(theta,period): #create a holder for our new theta measurement, theta2, and seed it with the initial value of theta. theta2 = [theta[0]] #we need to compare our current theta measurement against the previous one. thus, we store the initial value so there are no initial jumps. last_theta = theta[0] #create a holder for the number of times we have transitioned through another period mem = 0 # Starting at our 2nd data point(index 1) for t_ii,item in zip(t[1:],theta[1:]): #compare our current theta against the last theta dt = (item - last_theta) #check if there is a big jump in the positive or negative direction, and if there is, subtract or add one period value to mem if dt\u0026gt;(period/2): mem-=period if dt\u0026lt;(-period/2): mem+=period # compute the corrected value of theta and add to theta2 theta2.append(item+mem) # update last_theta last_theta = item # reform theta2 as a numpy array theta2 = numpy.array(theta2) # and return it return theta2 now run the function on our two guesses for vector 1 and vector 2\ntheta_v1_u = unwrap(theta_v1,2*math.pi) theta_v2_u = unwrap(theta_v2,2*math.pi) By subtracting the initial values for theta_1 and theta_2 we obtain two guesses for the same angle value.\ntheta_v1_u-=theta_v1_u.min() theta_v2_u-=theta_v2_u.min() Plot the corrected values\nplt.plot(t,theta_v1_u) plt.plot(t,theta_v2_u) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f4e4150a010\u0026gt;] The two measurements\nCompute the average of these two samples.

To make a good guess, however, we can reconstruct the step signal sent by the ESP32 and place it one time-step in front of any observed motion in the frames.\nFirst, we make a filter to only look at data values less than a second, just to zoom in on the first transition\ntime_filter = t\u0026lt;1 We then find the index of the first point in time where theta starts moving in order to guess the time-delay of our first command signal. We find it hueristically by finding the theta value that more than 1% of the full range of observed thetas from min(theta), starting at t=0. We save that index as jj, and identify the starting time, t_0, using the index\njj = theta_u[time_filter] \u0026gt; (theta_u[time_filter].max() - theta_u[time_filter].min())*.01 + theta_u[time_filter].min() t_0_kk = (t[time_filter][jj]).idxmin() t_0 = t[t_0_kk] t_0 0.5015946 We then plot the moment motion starts on top of the adjusted theta values:\nplt.plot(t[time_filter],theta_u[time_filter]) plt.plot(t[t_0_kk],theta_u[t_0_kk],\u0026#39;ro\u0026#39;) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f4e4153e910\u0026gt;] The point motion starts\nThis means the signal must have been sent at least one time-step before this. Maybe more, but the best-case scenario for lag would be one frame of video.\nLets create a function that can generate a step function with the following parameters\nA: amplitude f: frequency w: width (as a fraction of the full time step) of the positive portion of the square wave b: y-offset A = math.pi f = .5 w = .5 b = 0 def square(t,A,f,w,b,t_0): y = (t-t_0)*f y = y%1 y = (y\u0026lt;w)*1 y = A*y +b return y y = square(t,A,f,w,b,t_0) plt.plot(t[time_filter],theta_u[time_filter]) plt.plot(t[time_filter],y[time_filter]) plt.plot(t[t_0_kk],theta_u[t_0_kk],\u0026#39;ro\u0026#39;) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f4e40c70fd0\u0026gt;] The guessed control signal\nNow lets check our results over all the collected data\nplt.plot(t,y) plt.plot(t,theta_u) [\u0026lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f4e40c74850\u0026gt;] Checking our work\nit looks good!

By attaching RC servos, they can program their own motions and make unique, bio-inspired robots over the course of a week. The camp has grown well and I am working on refining the camp for younger students. This summer I taught students 13-17.\nWhile students are easily inspired by nature, I struggle to get through the concepts of programming gaits from concept to implementation. I have been looking for a way to more easily help them investigate and identify workable walking gaits. Here is my progress so far.\nWhat is the project? I\u0026rsquo;ve created a little MicroPython-based project on that combines the following:\nAn ESP32 microcontroller running MicroPython a basic RC servo class for converting position commands to a PWM signal the microdot web \u0026ldquo;micro\u0026rdquo; framework for serving a simple web app for controlling gait parameters The ability to work on either an existing wifi network or standalone as an access point. The project can be found on Github. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to get it running:\nInstall a code editor for working with the ESP32. I prefer VSCode with the Pymakr-preview plugin; Thonny is a rudimentary yet functioning alternative Flash micropython v1.20 or newer on to your ESP Open up the project and define an internet-connected wifi access point to connect to (for the first time). Upload the project to the microcvontroller and reset the ESP. I have tutorials for each of these steps. Please reach out if you would like more details.\nThe ESP, when started up, will download a couple libraries from the internet and then soft reset itself. Once restarted, it will host a webpage at its ip address. You can use the page to control various aspects of the servos.\nOnce the libraries are downloaded, you can also reprogram the boot.py file so that the ESP acts as its own wifi-access point.\nI have provided a basic example with four servos. The schematic can be seen here:\nSchematic\nBreadboard\nSinusoidal Control Each servo is controlled by the following equation\n$\\text{y}=A\\sin\\left(2\\pi(ft-l_x)\\right)+b$\nwhere $y$ is the desired angle, $t$ is the current time in seconds, and the other variables in the expression correspond to the following adjustable parameters:\nParameter Meaning $A$ Amplitude $f$ frequency $b$ Y-offset $l_x$ Servo x time offset This gives you the ability to control the amplitude of your signal with $A$:\nAmplitude\nYou can also change the frequency of your signal using $f$:\nFrequency\nYou can shift the output of the desired output up or down with $b$\nY-Offset\nYou can also shift the timing of your signal by playing with $l_x$\nTime Offset\nGaits The time offset paramters, $l_x$, are specified in fractions of a full cycle. Thus, $l_x=0$ means the sinusoid crosses the x axis traveling in the positive direction at t=0, $l_x=0.5$ means the sinusoid is shifted in x by $\\frac{f}{2}$ (crosses teh x axis traveling in the negative direction), and $l=1$ means your signal has wrapped around back to the beginning again. Thus, if you want to program a series of motors to be time-shifted in terms of fractions of a gait, you just have to play with the $l_x$ parameters to achieve very different results.\nYou can adjust all $l_1$, $l_2$, $l_3$, $l_4$ to be evenly distributed in time:\nFour Servos\nOr you can sequence two to be nearly on top of one another:\nDifferent Timings\nVideos Controlling Gait parameters ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/work-blog/2023-11-07-gaits-with-microdot/","tags":["micropython","esp32","robotics","servo","microdot"],"title":"Adjusting Gait Timing with an ESP32-based Web Framework in MicroPython"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction The purpose of this example is to show how easy it is to create spherical mechanisms in MuJoCo.\nMuJoCo is a great resource for studying dynamics of rigid body systems, is great for robotics, and has been a recent focus of mine as I am converting some of my course material over to use it for studying foldable mechanisms.\nThis example goes through the following steps. It permits you to specify four joints in the x-y plane that serve as your spherical joints. It then creates four thin meshes based on those joint locations and populates an xml template with the joint locations and mesh file information. The simulation then runs, showing off the parallel nature of the mechanism\nThe \u0026lt;weld\u0026gt; element in the xml is responsible for closing the kinematic loop, and is quite easy to use for flat-foldable kinematics. One thing to note in my example is that I create a duplicate body (\u0026quot;Ap\u0026quot;) to my fixed base (\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;), and then use a weld to constrain (\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;) to (\u0026quot;Ap\u0026quot;). Because the mechanism is defined in its flat state, the transformation to map (\u0026quot;Ap\u0026quot;) to (\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;) needs no offset and no rotation (relpose=\u0026quot;0 0 0 1 0 0 0\u0026quot; anchor=\u0026quot;0 0 0\u0026quot;). Below is a description of the code in more detail.\nSteps First, import the necessary packages\nimport os import mujoco import numpy import mediapy as media import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pygmsh Define four joints as 3d vectors in the xy plane\nv1 = [0,-1,0] v2 = [1,-1,0] v3 = [1,1,0] v4 = [-2,1,0] Assemble vectors into sequences I can use for generating meshes\nv = v1,v2,v3,v4 ab = [] for a,b in zip(v,v[1:]+v[:-1]): ab.append((a,b)) print(ab) [([0, -1, 0], [1, -1, 0]), ([1, -1, 0], [1, 1, 0]), ([1, 1, 0], [-2, 1, 0]), ([-2, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0])] Create meshes by extruding triangles by a thickness\nthickness = .1 filenames = [] for ii,(a,b) in enumerate(ab): filename = \u0026#39;mesh_{0:02.0f}\u0026#39;.format(ii) print(filename) with pygmsh.geo.Geometry() as geom: #create a triangle from 0,0 to the next two vertices poly = geom.add_polygon([(0,0),a[:2],b[:2]],mesh_size=2) #extrude the polygon geom.extrude(poly, [0.0, 0, thickness], num_layers=1) mesh = geom.generate_mesh() filenames.append(filename) mesh.write(filename+\u0026#39;.stl\u0026#39;,file_format=\u0026#39;stl\u0026#39;,binary=True) I got some warnings about meshio here, which can be ignored.\nIt should be noted that pygmsh does not do a good job of finding the proper vertex order for identifying outward normal vectors for faces, which could lead to improper mass calculations if not handled properly by mujoco. Future work should include finding a better mesher, or, temporarily, using meshlab to correct triangle normals to face outward, as is standard.\nDefine xml template. The filenames and joint axes are automatically generated.\n(This should eventually be further abstracted so as to generate n bodies (recursively), but for now its statically defined for four bodies.)\nxml_template = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \u0026lt;mujoco\u0026gt; \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;flag contact=\u0026#34;disable\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/option\u0026gt; \u0026lt;asset\u0026gt;{filenames} \u0026lt;/asset\u0026gt; \u0026lt;worldbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;light name=\u0026#34;top\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body name=\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;mesh\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; density=\u0026#34;1000\u0026#34; mesh=\u0026#34;mesh_00\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;1 0 0 1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;joint type=\u0026#34;hinge\u0026#34; axis=\u0026#34;{j2}\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;mesh\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; density=\u0026#34;1000\u0026#34; mesh=\u0026#34;mesh_01\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;1 0 1 1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;joint type=\u0026#34;hinge\u0026#34; axis=\u0026#34;{j3}\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;mesh\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; density=\u0026#34;1000\u0026#34; mesh=\u0026#34;mesh_02\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;1 1 0 1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;joint type=\u0026#34;hinge\u0026#34; axis=\u0026#34;{j4}\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;mesh\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; density=\u0026#34;1000\u0026#34; mesh=\u0026#34;mesh_03\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;0 1 0 1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body name=\u0026#34;Ap\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;joint type=\u0026#34;hinge\u0026#34; axis=\u0026#34;{j1}\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;geom type=\u0026#34;mesh\u0026#34; pos=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; density=\u0026#34;1000\u0026#34; mesh=\u0026#34;mesh_00\u0026#34; rgba=\u0026#34;1 0 0 1\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/worldbody\u0026gt; \u0026lt;equality\u0026gt; \u0026lt;weld name=\u0026#34;weld1\u0026#34; active=\u0026#34;true\u0026#34; body1=\u0026#34;A\u0026#34; body2=\u0026#34;Ap\u0026#34; relpose=\u0026#34;0 0 0 1 0 0 0\u0026#34; anchor=\u0026#34;0 0 0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/equality\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/mujoco\u0026gt; \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; populate xml template with joint and file information\nfilename_string = \u0026#39;\u0026#39; for filename in filenames: s=\u0026#39;\\n\u0026lt;mesh name=\u0026#34;{filename}\u0026#34; file=\u0026#34;{filename}.stl\u0026#34; /\u0026gt;\u0026#39;.format(filename=filename) filename_string+=s v1s = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join([str(item) for item in v1]) v2s = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join([str(item) for item in v2]) v3s = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join([str(item) for item in v3]) v4s = \u0026#39; \u0026#39;.join([str(item) for item in v4]) xml=xml_template.format(j1=v1s,j2=v2s,j3=v3s,j4=v4s,filenames=filename_string) print(xml) Run Simulation\nmodel = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string(xml) data = mujoco.MjData(model) renderer = mujoco.Renderer(model) duration = 10 framerate = 30 frames = [] mujoco.mj_resetData(model, data) while data.time \u0026lt; duration: mujoco.mj_step(model, data) if len(frames) \u0026lt; data.time * framerate: renderer.update_scene(data) pixels = renderer.render() frames.append(pixels) media.show_video(frames, fps=framerate) This browser does not support the video tag.

Mujoco\u0026rsquo;s XML documentation doesn\u0026rsquo;t serve as a full spec, and is not sufficient for most people to be able to understand its inner workings. Few examples of good working dynamic robots exist in the wild especially ones with built-in compliance, closed kinematic loops good examples of implementing constraints for one or two bodies are hard to come by and don\u0026rsquo;t span all the corner cases That said, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a couple important things so far:\nConstraints are consistent with the way the robot is declared in XML. Constraints are relative to the local frame of the bodies you are working in. This means that you should try to declare bodies that don\u0026rsquo;t need to be drastically re-oriented in order to line them up to each other before \u0026ldquo;welding\u0026rdquo; them together, if possible. You can initialize your system to a state in which the constraints are more easily solved, so that even if the xml defines states where the representation is easy but it is in some sort of singularity, you can still solve it in the way you want.

One little gotcha that we discovered at the bus station was that we had to buy platform tickets, which let us out into the bus platform here. This was new to us.\nThe bus ride to Sofia was relatively less eventful than our trip to Skopje, but an interesting difference at the border was that we all had to get out of the bus in order to individually leave Macedonia on foot. The bus came to meet us after we left customs. Once at the Bulgarian station, we had to take all of our baggage out and let a dog come by and sniffed our luggage\nThe bus ride was relativly smooth and uneventful. After we got to Sofia, we walked the 30-minute walk to our place. I had advocated for the walk, and, though I always like to walk to get to the place, it was a little longer than I expected. Nevertheless, we made it there and unloaded our stuff. I went out to get groceries.\nWe walked out to a park to help the kids let off some steam. The playground in the city garden was unimpressive, but it allowed me and sara to get some things done, like find an ATM, buy some wine for our friends, and pick up some dinner.\nSaturday, August 26 We learned that our friends would not be joining us on their original flight, as there had been some\nWe did school in the morning and then walked through town. We walked through Knyazheska Garden, where we found a remnant of Bulgaria\u0026rsquo;s communist past, fenced in to stave off the graffitos.\nWe continued on to Brisova Gradina Park, found a bigger playground, had a picnic with some snacks, and took kids to read in the shade. Knowing we needed more food than that, we had a late lunch at a bar behind the stadium (called Behind), where we split some sandwiches and potato chips and watched the track and field world championships on TV. We walked back to the apartment and had a special sushi dinner nearby. The kids were tired; we put them to bed after watching a little Harry Potter, and waited up for our friends to arrive. Sara headed to the airport and I stayed with the kids. Our friends arrived around 10:15, after taking almost 32 hours to get to Bulgaria. They were missing 3 pieces of luggage.\nSunday, August 27 When we woke up, \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; Ben (Our friend Ben Allred), Sam, and I went to a local bakery along the main drag and (big) Ben introduced us to \u0026ldquo;banitsa\u0026rdquo;, which is very similar to the \u0026ldquo;burek\u0026rdquo; we found in Macedonia. We bought a bunch and brought them back to the group. After breakfast, we decided to do a walking tour of some of the street art in one of the nearby suburbs. We finally managed to figure out how the subway system worked and ended up in Skradin, which is both the name of the underground subway station as well as the old Roman town that it is built alongside. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool to be able to see old Roman ruins as you\u0026rsquo;re walking down the steps to the train platform.\nWe eventually made it out to the neighborhood where all the street art was after getting off one stop too early. We walked to our first two street arts and then got coffee and let the kids play and playground. Continuing on, we found about 10 total large murals on the sides of buildings that had been completed by some of the same people over numerous years.\nIt was a long, dry walk in the midday heat but the kids all did a great job, especially Max and Ember.\nWe went to a place called Raketa Rakia for lunch a little bit closer into town, which was a special treat. The serving staff was fun and patient with us, while we tried a bunch of different local dishes and finished it off with a rakia tasting.\nAfter lunch we went across the street to the park, filled up our water bottles and let the kids play in the concrete slide with some leaves. It\u0026rsquo;s the little things. After getting a call from the airline baggage people, we headed back on the tram into town. We got one out of three bags, and gelato for the kids.\nIn the evening, Ben and I did the Sophia walking tour, which was really cool. And informative. We brought back much of what we heard to Sara and Laura that evening. We sampled several different varieties of the local beer and called it a night.\nMonday, August 28 The next day we went to a very old church that had examples of 800-year-old frescos. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t take pictures inside, but it was quite dramatic.\nWe got tickets and learned that we had to wait 30 minutes to enter, and that we only could go in for 10 minutes at a time. We seemed to be in everybody\u0026rsquo;s way, but despite that, it was a really cool experience. The church is one of a kind.\nAfter the church we headed up the hill and did a hike to the X waterfall. We ended up hiking over 5 miles, which was more than we expected.\nOn the way down, we got ice cream for the kids and beer for the adults had a roadside cafe as we waited for two taxis\nThat evening we had a great dinner at a local restaurant that included algae-tinted beer and a variety of local foods.\nTuesday, August 29 The next morning, I hiked over to the train station and got our tickets for Istanbul while Sara and Ben headed to the airport to get the rental cars for our trip into Bulgaria. After getting back I helped watch the kids in pack while we waited for the cars.\nWe drove out of Sophia heading for baliko ternavo. Along the way, we stopped to visit a particularly cool cave that sometimes is the site for chamber music and other concerts. We had already seen two other caves, but this one was particularly cool because of the size of the chambers as well as the age of some of the stalactites. One of the largest columns was over 3 million years old and 60 m in circumference, according to our guide. Big Ben did a great job translating, even though some of the other tourists had to help out from time to time.\nin a little town just outside for a late lunch/early dinner. Finally getting to our place around 6:00, we found ourselves rolling our bags along a a very old cobblestonestreet w to our one night Airbnb. We had been particularly excited about this place, but it turned out to be a little sketchier than our expectations. We did however find an underground lair that seemed to be a former communist drinking hangout. As we sat there after the kids went to bed though, we started hearing scratching all around us. It turned out to be wood beetles eating away at the building surrounding us. It was both spooky and scary to hear the building be eaten to dust. We resolved to tell our host about that little detail.\nWednesday, August 30 For breakfast we went to the pinko Cafe, a pink-themed cafe filled with different pink creatures and pink dishes. I think it was also a reference to Bulgaria\u0026rsquo;s communist past, being nestled in the hotel Kiev. We then hiked to the castle. The kids investigated a scorpion and a catapult and we talked about how each one stored energy to launch projectiles. Sam wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling well so he and Sara waited while the rest of us climbed up to the strangest church we\u0026rsquo;d ever been inside at the top. The interior was something\u0026hellip; Gothic? Brutalist? Slavic? We couldn\u0026rsquo;t pick the name for whatever it was, but it seemed like an interior shot from game of thrones. The mural itself was also pretty different for the inside of church. After that we hustled back to the apartment and packed our bags. We drove on towards Byala.\nWe stopped at an ancient rock outcropping that has evidence of ancient civilization, and includes the \u0026ldquo;Horseman of Madara\u0026rdquo;. We walked around all the structures.\nWhen we got to the Byala, the kids found the Black Sea while (Big) Ben and I went and got dinner, which included some adventurous food, including fried scad.\nThursday, August 31 We played on the beach, the kids went to a water slide, I caught up on email, and we went to dinner. It was a great, relaxing day\nFriday, September 1 We packed our things and moved on to Nessabar for a quick stop. We got lunch at a quaint spot and then walked around the town a bit while the girls did some shopping on their own. We found said goodbye to the Black Sea, walked back to our cars, and continued on to Plovdiv. We got to our place nestled right in the middle of the old part of town, and walked to dinner at a place down the street. The whole center of town comes alive at night with restaurants spilling out onto the street. We got the kids ice cream as we meandered home.\nSaturday, September 2 We hiked up three of Plovdiv\u0026rsquo;s seven hills and saw lots of sights. Laura, (little) Ben, and I hiked up to the top of the monument. We met up with the rest of the crowd, ate a quick lunch at the end of the children\u0026rsquo;s train line, and continued on to the children\u0026rsquo;s train. It didn\u0026rsquo;t run again for a couple hours, so we let the kids play in a playground while we got coffee and beer. We were all feeling tired and a bit out of it. The children\u0026rsquo;s train was stuffy and slow, and not worth the time or hike. We taxied home and ate dinner on the roof.\nSunday, September 3 I woke up feeling a cold coming on. We hiked up into the old town\nMonday, September 4 Tuesday, September 5 Notes from Sofia Walking Tour Lion Tsar Boris assassination 40 hot mineral springs Square of tolerance Sallow makers Public bath Mineral springs Bankia Pancherevo Presidency has hotel and casino and church Bath house to church logically Church to mosque to church Every Sunday is an impromptu dance Marchiniza Red and white ties Hang on first blossoming tree Kornac National gallery St Sofia church Justinian 6 th century ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/15-sofia-and-bulgaria/","tags":null,"title":"Bulgaria (Draft)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Monday, August 21, 2023 In the morning we walked out of Ohrid\u0026rsquo;s old town, down the street, and to the bus stop. Walking down the stairs, about a hundred steps, with my arms full of bags was not my favorite, but it was pretty special that we could hike with all of our luggage to the bus stop, about a kilometer, without needing any special help.\nOur bus was more of a minibus this time, and it fit the road that we traveled on. It seems like Macedonia is overhauling its highway system pretty dramatically, but we were not fortunate enough to be on those roads yet. It was one of the twistiest and turniest roads of our travels, with the drivers going many different speeds, necessitating our driver to pass a lot of people at high speed around tight corners going up and down a hill. We all looked a little green after that trip.\nOnce at the bus station in Skopje, we quickly found a taxi that took us to our next apartment, a third story loft above a coffee shop owned by the host. It was very quaint but a little too warm when we entered. The town of Skopje is surrounded by mountains and seemed a little bit lower in elevation than Ohrid, which made our time in the town a little bit more constrained by the hot weather. I went out to the store to get some fresh food and we had a pasta dinner and an early evening.\nTuesday, August 22, 2023 The next morning we headed out early so that we can see the city before it got too warm. It was due to get up to around 100°F, so we wanted to be back pretty early. We walked straight into the main square that has a gigantic sculpture of Alexander the Great. Walking around the square and along our path, we realized that Skopje is overrun with sculptures, all of them big, representing all sorts of events and people from Macedonia\u0026rsquo;s past. We learned only later the provenance and reasons for many of these sculptures, and that many of the largest ones were less than a decade old.\nWe made our way across the \u0026ldquo;old stone bridge\u0026rdquo; and into the bazaar, where we looked for evidence of magical artifacts and had a somewhat traditional breakfast. Afterwards we headed home and did nearly a full day of school, picking up some street food for lunch. Sara set up shop in the little office area of the apartment and got some work done. I took Max downstairs to get a coffee, and treated him to a \u0026ldquo;kid coffee\u0026rdquo;.\nThat evening at 5:00 I met up with a tourgroup and did the \u0026ldquo;Free Skopje Walking Tour\u0026rdquo;. I learned a lot of interesting facts about the buildings, the history, the people, and the politics. Some of the most interesting things that I learned about regarded the \u0026ldquo;Skopje 2014\u0026rdquo; iniative, and some of the controversies surrounding the many art installations and renovations that no littered the city and halted mid-project around 2018. Looking around it was then pretty obvious to see how much the city had changed, and why it have been so controversial.\nWednesday, August 23, 2023 The next morning we visited Matka canyon, a local tourist attraction that is about a 45-minute drive out of the city. We took a taxi there and were dropped off at the last bus stop. We hiked all the way to the end of the trail, about 4 km from the entrance, plus about two more from the bus stop. It was a unique hike because so few people do it in favor of just taking a boat. The trail gets smaller and smaller, and by about the third kilometer in you\u0026rsquo;re bushwhacking along a narrow trail or beside a steep cliff with battered railings. The hike was worth it just because of that, and I was excited to reward the kids\u0026rsquo; effort with the destination, a cave.\nUnfortunately, my directions failed to mention that our route had one small problem\u0026hellip; There was no bridge across the river! Making it to the end of the trail, we saw people disembarking the water taxis and pontoon boats that had ferried them up to the opposite bank, but after scrambling down to the bank of the river, we saw that the only way across was to either swim or ask one of the boats. Luckily, as we got to the bottom of the canyon a boat operator asked us if we\u0026rsquo;d like a ride, which we accepted. He ferried us across to a small platform, where we spent about an hour snacking and jumping in the water. Mom was the first to take the plunge, Sam jumped in seven times, and I jumped in a couple times along with the others (Mom offered ice cream to anyone who jumped in). The water was about 10°C, which really took the breath away!\nAfter drying off I took the kids up to the cave entrance and we explored it for a little while. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t big, but pretty interesting. After hiking up to the entrance, then back down into the first chamber we found two underground lakes. The water level seemed to be about the same level as the river itself, which explains the cold temperatures we felt in the reservoir, assuming that it mixes somewhere underground.\nComing down the steps from the cave entrance we saw that our boat operator had returned. He showed us to a second boat that took us back to the mouth of the canyon. We walked back to the bus stop, grabbing ice cream and roasted corn on the way, and found a taxi to take us back to our place for a thousand Dinar.\nNot wanting to cook that night he walked back to the bazaar and had a very traditional dinner of kebabs. We realized that the kebabs everyone was talking about was the same as the cevapi we had in Croatia, just different spelling. We paired them with a shopska salad, a dish of beans, some ajvar (a traditional pepper spread), and some homemade bread and yogurt. Delicous and satisfying.\nAfter walking home we walked through the local school yard where about 100 kids were playing in the dusk, after an obviously hot day in the city. Our kids played for about 10 minutes; I then took them up to bed while Sara prepared for a work meeting.\nThursday, August 24, 2023 On our last full day in Skopje, Sara and I mixed a little bit of work time with school time for the kids. The kids were all a bit twitchy, and had a rougher time than usual concentrating on school work; Max won our game of \u0026ldquo;whoever is the most efficient at getting their work done gets to go get coffee with dad\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are breakfast and lunch at home on our last day, trying to finish up all the fresh food in the fridge.\nThe kids had invented a fun game earlier in the week where they made a airplanes and loaded them with envelopes that they used to send a message to each other by flying them through the apartment. We all played before dinner.\nWe ate out at a nice local restaurant that evening and treated ourselves to pizza, fish soup, tomato soup, pasta, and a beet, carrot and arugula salad.\nOn our way home, Sam tripped over Max while teasing him. The goose egg he got served a (fleeting) lesson in if/then.\nNotes from Skopje Tour Macedonian Color revolution Two ATMs that don\u0026rsquo;t charge commission Pink ATMS halkbank (turkish) Millennium cross Bus Daily ticket 500 to take boat in Canyon Produce market Mall Burek == Bypek In the morning Smaller the better Make dox event in Skopje Rebuilt with new street names Bus 25 tires thru Frida Bus 60 to the canyon 120 cash Brahzhov Project 2014 Free train station museum Macedonian struggle Gebbermalo with traditional music Bohemian district Slower food Ladino Jewish language Exiled Spanish Churches built after mid 1800 Hammam ottoman bath Not a bath Bazaar Last thematic street is gold/jewelry Karabanserie Colective had the craft beer Hidden church Food Tafche grafche baked beans Chopska salad Ajvar ayvar red pepper spread Drink Vranac Rakia like grappa.

Most cars aren\u0026rsquo;t allowed in without a pass, so we were dropped off outside the gate and rolled in through the arch. Our house was quite close. We dumped our bags and, after a long day, headed to \u0026ldquo;Pizza Leonardo\u0026rdquo; where we got four \u0026ldquo;standard-size\u0026rdquo; pizzas (we never found out whether it was the Balkan standard #4 pizza or more of a EU standard). Sunset on the lake was really pretty from our balcony.\nThursday, August 17, 2023 The next morning we headed out to \u0026ldquo;Samuel\u0026rsquo;s Fortress\u0026rdquo;, a castle once occupied by Tsar Samuel amongst various invaders and siege-layers over the years. The castle had been rebuilt; the castellations at the top were complete (and used concrete to hold it together), and some of the new walkways did not exactly match up with the old walls. But at least there was a railing, in contrast to Albania.\nWalking down the hill from the castle, we walked by an archaeological site within a monastery; we didn\u0026rsquo;t go in because we were getting a little hangry. Stopping for a snack outside of the monastery, the kids did some reading and writing. We walked into town and headed along the shore on a boardwalk, which took us by a couple small beaches and bars to a fantastic find of a restaurant (It was highly rated in Sara\u0026rsquo;s Eastern Europe book 15 years ago). We ate a great lunch featuring a bunch of different fish. We walked back to the apartment; Max and I napped while the kids did some school. Dinner was at home that night.\nFriday, August 18, 2023 Max woke up early and went out to the living room by himself. He was so quiet for so long that we had to check in on him\u0026hellip;we found him quietly at work on his \u0026ldquo;workbook\u0026rdquo;, a pre-school level book we brought with us for him to work on colors, letters, and numbers. Very impressive. We did some school in the morning and then headed out to find a park and learn about boat rental options. Mom went for a walk while I watched the kids, and then we switched; I made it up the main walkway all the way to the bazaar before turning around. We got Doner Kebabs for lunch and brought them back to the park.\nAt the park, Sara met up with a woman she had been chatting with recently about a pop-up school she was setting up in Ohrid; she lives in Canada and had her two kids with her, and were staying, along with her mom, in Ohrid for several months. Ben, Sam, and Max really enjoyed playing with them at the park. I headed back to the apartment to get some work done, and they met me at home for a brief wind-down.\nWe met back up for a beach dinner while the kids used their new nets that Sara got them to fish for minnows.\nSaturday, August 19, 2023 The kids woke up and did school early. After that We met up with our friends and made our way to the \u0026ldquo;semi-submarine\u0026rdquo;, to get there a little bit before the 11:00 a.m. departure, but found it full. We decided to stick around for the 12:00 p.m. tour. The kids played in the park, I went to the bakery and got some different things to try, and at noon we embarked on our voyage under the lake.\nIt was a pretty neat tour. We saw lots of little fish, I saw a water snake swimming on the lake bed, and we saw a lot of seaweed. The boat itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t ever go underwater but, unlike a glass bottom boat, you\u0026rsquo;re fully immersed in the water when you\u0026rsquo;re downstairs. It was also a little disorienting to look out the thick glass as the boat moved forward, because the warped view through the thick glass made it look like you were moving inside a kaliedescope.\nWe got off the boat and made our way to a water taxi and immediately took a short little tour on our way to a nearby beach recommended by our friend. We spent the whole afternoon there, with our kids in the water almost the whole time. Though the sun was hot, there was luckily a bar nearby; we finished off the afternoon with some beers.\nLooking across the lake, we saw thunderheads forming and decided we needed to make our way back to Ohrid before it caught us. It was 5:00 anyways and we knew our kids would fall apart soon if they didn\u0026rsquo;t get a proper dinner. The water taxi came back for us and we made our way home. Dinner that night was very simple and satisfying, with a lot of veggies.\nThe thunderstorm finally hit later that night with some pretty dramatic lightning across the water.\nSunday, August 20, 2023 Sam and I walked into town to grab some donuts and sweet pastries for breakfast. We again did some schoolwork in the morning followed by lunch, but one in our midst was a bit emotional. Max couldn\u0026rsquo;t ask anything nicely without falling apart crying if he heard a no. Seeing that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to end unless we put a stop to it, Max and I stayed at home so that he could take a nap. We had had a long couple days and he needed some extra sleep. Sara and the other boys went to the beach to meet up with ouir friends again a little way down the shore.\nI got some work done while Max slept, and then when he woke up \u0026ndash; in a much better mood \u0026ndash; we made our way to the other kids at the beach. I rented a stand-up paddle board and took Ben and Sam out for a short trip each.\nWe walked back to town together with our friends and said goodbye along the quay.

The kids played and mom returned the car. When she got back, Sam and I went to the grocery store and stocked up on food. We watched the first half of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as a treat in the evening. The place was really nice; every possible extra was thought of, and it had obviously been updated recently. Very homey and pleasant.\nMonday, August 14 After school in the morning, I took the kids out so that Sara could get some work done. We did a big loop, checking out a number of sights, including the Taiwan Youth Park, Skanderbeg Square, Et\u0026rsquo;hem Bej Mosque, the Tirana Clocktower, the Tirana Castle (some old walls surrounding a modern outdoor mall), and the Grand Park. Sara met us at the Grand park around 3pm; we got gelato on the way home BEFORE dinner.\nTuesday, August 15 The kids woke up and did their journals early. After breakfast, Sara and the kids headed back to the playground in the Grand Park for outdoor school interspersed with playing while I got some work done. I showed up around 11:15 and we had a snack / early lunch.\nI stayed with the kids after that at the park till 2 while Sara went home to work. I would take one kid at a time to read with me while the others played. That works out pretty well, because the one with me always wants to join the other 2, who stay occupied. The threat is, \u0026ldquo;If you come over to me, I will make you read\u0026rdquo;, so they keep their distance.\nWe walked home around 2, had a really big snack at 3:30 and headed out to Bunk\u0026rsquo;Art 2, an old cold war bunker that had been recommended to us. According to our \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo;, it was converted into an art space. Instead we found a very intense cold war museum with graphic photos for the kids to ask about. It was a bit too much of a shock, and certainly too heavy of a topic to take on right before dinner and bed. We lasted about 20 minutes. Given the cost of entrance, that was about $1/minute. No matter; we barely made it home without kids falling apart for hunger and tiredness. Ate at Opa!, a fast food greek place right in front of our place. Not bad, but I can imagine it would start to get old quickly.\nWednesday, August 16 Sara went for an early run and the kids played. They did some school after breakfast while we packed. I went to go print off our bus tickets, and then Ben and I found a cafe to just sit and relax for a while. We caught a cab for the bus station, had a quick coffee next door, and boarded our bus for Ohrid, North Macedonia.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/12-tirana/","tags":null,"title":"Tirana, Albania"},{"categories":null,"contents":" When I\u0026rsquo;m developing a course or camp, I often don\u0026rsquo;t have time to do in-depth research on parts or to pre-order multiple rounds of test parts in order to properly research what I need. But RC servo motors \u0026ndash; to a robotics professor like me \u0026ndash; are one of the cornerstones to teaching half of the sensing \u0026amp; actuation loop so often required of a robotic or embedded system. If the servo doesn\u0026rsquo;t work right, the class stalls out and the students get frustrated! So, over the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized I have to find a solution to the following question\nHow do I find the cheapest functional RC servos that work with most available sources of power?\nThis is harder than it might seem. Even the cheapest RC servo motors are incredibly complex systems, if you think about it. They include a (plastic) housing, a (plastic) transmission usually composed of multiple gear stages, a motor, feedback, and often a microcontroller or circuit-based control scheme to provide feedback. And the cheapest servos are only a couple dollars a piece! So a lot can go wrong.\nMechanical Issues Stripped gears, splines, or screw threads. The plastic in these servos is so cheap that even the smallest over-torque scenario can strip elements of the transmission. Backlash in the transmission. Many of the cheapest rc servos forego proper bearings, using the housing itself or small brass bushings instead. This can warp or wear quickly when operated above a cheap servo\u0026rsquo;s minimal torque limits, causing the servo to inherit some backlash (\u0026ldquo;play\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;slop\u0026rdquo;). Poor feedback: The potentiometers in these small servos are not very sensitive, and don\u0026rsquo;t provide a lot of position precision. Sending a command outside of the allowed frequency range can also jam the shaft or cause a mechanical / electrical failure. I\u0026rsquo;ve even seen shafts start to rotate continuously when the commands were outside of the allowable range. Electrical issues Over-Voltage: Cheap RC servos are not electrically robust, and so operating them outside of their ratings is going to break some of them. One common mistake is using too high of a voltage. This can cause either instant death or cause the motor to heat up, melting a lead or coil. Miswiring: These servos are also intolerant to reverse voltage situations, because they don\u0026rsquo;t include basic protections built into more complex (expensive) servos. Plugging in the wrong pins to power and ground is a quick way to destroy a little servo. Overheating: Even if rated for 6V, it is sometimes best to use less voltage than that. Running a servo near stall, or in situations where they\u0026rsquo;re jerking under load will cause little servos to heat up quickly. Without a metal casing or proper heat sinks, the motors just keep getting hotter until they short and die. Of course, you can avoid all of these issues simply by paying more for a higher-quality part. This is what we do in research. But think about the challenges of teaching a course\u0026hellip;each dollar you spend on parts gets multiplied many times over. A simple robot, consisting of 4 $5 servos, will cost the course 600 dollars for a 30 person class. Upgrading to a 10 dollar motor with bearings and metal gears costs 600 dollars more! This is not sustainable in a college setting, let alone a K-12 classroom, even if you utilize project teams to reduce the number of systems.\nBut, if you do happen to find a servo that avoids the worst of these issues, one of the most pernicious things I\u0026rsquo;ve found that crops up, even with a fairly robust, low-cost servo happens as you start to scale up the number of servos in a system, with an issue that relates to stall-torque.\nThe Stall Torque Issue Stall torque, as you may know, is the highest amount of current a motor can draw during normal operation, when the motor is not moving, or stalled. This is not a special case \u0026ndash; in robotics applications, your motors may be at rest much of the time. So whenever you are starting a motor from rest, you will observe a short period wher the motor is using the highest amount of power. This is related directly to the motor\u0026rsquo;s coil resistance and the voltage it is driven at through Ohm\u0026rsquo;s law, or $V=IR$. Once the motor starts moving, it generates velocity-dependent back-EMF through its coil windings that lowers the amount of current drawn through the coil. Unfortunately, though, as said before, in many robotics applications actuators are slow-moving or even stopped. This is exacerbated when motors are used in a synchronous fashion throughout a system, for example in a legged robot. Often times, in order to complete a standing, walking, or running gait, multiple motors will be moving in phase with each other, starting from rest at the same time, in different parts of the robot. This means that the worst case, startup from rest, potentially multiplies the current/power needs from a single actuator many times over. You always would like to be able to supply power to your system, even in the worst case, so this impacts your power bottom line by increasing your current needs.\nSo lets say you have a servo that nominally draws 100 mA while moving at top speed. You may find that, based on its coil resistance and nominal driving voltage, that it could draw 500-1000 mA in order to start moving! Considering the current available from AA or AAA batteries, computers\u0026rsquo; USB ports, 5V chargers, or single-cell lithium ion batteries, you can probably only \u0026ldquo;afford\u0026rdquo; to power one or two servos at a time, in the worst-case condition that they start and stop at roughly the same time.\nAgain, you could solve the problem in a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; system by simply buying a beefy power supply or bigger battery. But power is expensive, both money-wise, and mass-wise. So it is in our best interest to find a different way\u0026hellip;\nWhat happens when you do draw too much power? In a typical microcontroller-driven application, you \u0026ldquo;pull down\u0026rdquo; the voltage from its nominal level, causing it to dip briefly. For example, if using an ESP32 development board powered by a small battery, and the board needs (let\u0026rsquo;s say) at least 3.8V in order to supply the microcontroller with the required 3.3V to operate. If you start up several servos simultaneously and pull down the voltage below 3.8V, you could damage your power source, or at the very least pull down the output voltage below the ESP32 dev board\u0026rsquo;s minimum threshold, causing a \u0026ldquo;brownout\u0026rdquo;. Why is this a big deal? It resets your microcontroller, putting it into an unexpected state. It can also interrupt the PWM signal being sent to the servos, causing the servo to jiggle or jump. Jumping servos also act like a motor starting from rest, causing another brownout and another reset sequence. This can become an endless loop, with your microcontroller continually resetting itself, never recovering.\nWhat are some mitigations? You can add a big capacitor in parallel, to average out the transient peaks. But that only eliminates short-term peaks. What about when your power draw over 50-100ms continues to exceed your power supply\u0026rsquo;s available budget? Another good solution is to power the servo directly from a high capacity lithium ion battery; these have a relatively high current availability (unlike the smaller currents available through chip-basd regulated supplies, small batteries, or USB cables from your computer or a small charger). But that increased capacity comes at a high cost to the classroom, which we\u0026rsquo;ve already said we\u0026rsquo;d like to avoid.\nBut, for small, low-power robotics projects, we often don\u0026rsquo;t need that kind of power. The rest of this article describes my search for motors that didn\u0026rsquo;t need serious mitigation.\nTest Conditions I tried a number of strategies to find the nominal and worst-case performance of the servos I was testing. Here are some of them.\nPower I tried using USB power from my computer, as well as a 3A, 5V USB charger I found on amazon. These are both good starting points because they replicate what students will be using when debugging, as well as the cheapest non-computer power source. I tested servos with rechargeable AA and AAA lithium ion batteries, as well as some alkaline batteries (Energizer or similar) Typically, the servos perfomed worse with these batteries than with the wall charger. I assume their ability to supply peak current is limited and causes more brownouts. I tried using one or more 1000uF / 4700uF Electrolytic capacitors across the power rails to smooth out the peaks. A tantalum capacitor would have probably worked better with fast transient peaks though. I used an oscilloscope to verify dips on the vin line, though not across every combination of power, servo, and command, so I can\u0026rsquo;t share those details. Servo test conditions I ordered 4x of each servo I extensively tested, and tested 1x, 2x, and 4x of each. I played around with the timing of servo startup to reduce instantaneous current requirements, in order to test how multiple servos might work during normal operation. I also pushed the limits of the servos to match worst-case conditions. This was done by commanding large jumps in position, more frequently, and simultaneously across multiple servos Code I used the following code to test 1, 2, and 4 servos. I set l1, l2 , l3, and l4 to 0 to synchronize their motion so they all moved simultaneously, or to 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 duty cycle, respectivly, to distribute their motion throughout a cycle. To play with frequency and amplitude I increased f to 1 or 2 Hz to increase the frequency of cycling. I increased A to move from a smooth, sinusoidal motion to a sharper transition (note the use of output limits to protect the servo when increasing A.)\n#import all the libraries # from machine import Pin # from machine import PWM import math import time from machine import Pin from machine import PWM # define constants # This is the servo\u0026#39;s driving frequency, which equals 20ms (1/f=t). servo_frequency = 50 # This PWM value corresponds to the servo\u0026#39;s smallest angle (0) range_low = 28 # This PWM value corresponds to the servo\u0026#39;s largest angle (180) range_high = 122 # save the initial time in nanoseconds as t0 t0 = time.time_ns() def angle_to_pwm(degrees): \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; this function converts a desired angle to its corresponding PWM value, using the range_low and range_high constants defined inline \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; # compute output scaling output_range = range_high-range_low # compute input scaling input_range = 180-0 # divide the desired angle by the input scaling, multiply #by the output scaling, and add the range_low value as an offset. output_pwm = ((degrees/input_range)*output_range)+range_low if output_pwm \u0026lt; range_low: output_pwm = range_low if output_pwm \u0026gt; range_high: output_pwm = range_high # return the computed value as an integer return int(output_pwm) def get_seconds_float(): \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; This function accesses the internal time_ns() function and converts it to a floating point value in seconds \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; # get current time, t in nanoseconds t = time.time_ns() # subtract from t0 to obtain the time since the program began dt = t-t0 # convert to a float firsty, and then convert from nanoseconds # to seconds by multiplying by 10^9 dt = float(dt)/1e9 # return the change in time. return dt f = .5 A = 90 b = 90 l1 = 0 l2 = .25 l3 = .5 l4 = .75 # create a new PWM instance and call it servo1 servo1 = PWM(Pin(13), servo_frequency) servo2 = PWM(Pin(12), servo_frequency) servo3 = PWM(Pin(14), servo_frequency) servo4 = PWM(Pin(27), servo_frequency) # here is our main loop while True: # time.sleep is not as necessary...can be commented # out except if you want to print values out. #time.sleep(.01) # get the current time in (floating-point) seconds t = get_seconds_float() # compute the desired angle for servo 1 y1 = A*(math.sin((2*(f*t-l1))*math.pi)) + b y2 = A*(math.sin((2*(f*t-l2))*math.pi)) + b y3 = A*(math.sin((2*(f*t-l3))*math.pi)) + b y4 = A*(math.sin((2*(f*t-l4))*math.pi)) + b # print out the desired angle.

The Adafruit servos have always given me problems with stall current, which was the impetus for my search in the first place. They jiggled and jerked when I connected anything over 2 servos at the same time. Some of the other cheap brands I found on Amazon worked under load, at relatively high command frequency, with four servos attached to my computer\u0026rsquo;s USB port or 3A USB charger, all without browning out the microcontroller. Others needed a capacitor once I got up to 4x connected at the same time under simultaneous commands. The metal gear servos I purchased, though of seeming higher quality and being slightly more expensive, could not be used 4x at a time without dropping system voltage too low. Using 2x simultaneously seemed to be the limit.\nConclusions I\u0026rsquo;m writing this mostly from memory about 2 months after running my tests, so I have already forgotton some of the finer details of the procedure, and every permutation I tested. This writeup is based upon those recollections, so take everything with a grain of salt. One unfortunate thing I found as writing this up now two months later, however, was that many of the product descriptions, branding, and images on Amazon have already changed, and some parts are already out of stock. Thus, this article is already out of date if you\u0026rsquo;re just looking for my top pick.\nSo instead of drawing any direct conclusions about which RC servo to purchase for your class, here are my concluding thoughts:\nPre-testing the cheapest of the cheap servos is required if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to save money for a big purchase. Buy more than one of the same servo, and test the number that you expect your students to use simultaneously. Use code like that shared above to test best case and worse case conditions. If you\u0026rsquo;re asking your students to use these, you need to ensure at the very least that they will work under the most basic conditions. Test many servo brands before committing. Many of the servos you\u0026rsquo;ll find on Amazon are the same, but with different branding / stickers. If you\u0026rsquo;re buying from Amazon or similar, buy everything you need all at once, to ensure you get parts from the same product run and source. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume your next purchase will meet the same specs. Buy extra parts, because you will experience many initial or early failures, and your students will destroy more than you expect due to generally low-quality. Consider the cost of your power solution when selecting RC servos. USB chargers are a cheap option but keep you tethered to a PC or the wall. Typical AA batteries are heavy and cannot supply high amounts of peak current. Consider step-up regulators with a single-cell lithium ion battery. These seemed like a nice option that kept cost and mass lower, but this solution can add $30 dollars or more to a single system.

It was great to be able to walk the site with few tourists and take our time. But travel days are hard, and kids have only so much attention, so we moved on. We got to Gjirokaster in the afternoon, and, after a scary drive up a cobbled street, we found our hotel conveniently located in the center of the city\u0026rsquo;s bazaar. It was a great place, though perhaps a little noisy at night for a family with kids. Still, the location was perfect. Sara dumped the car, we unloaded, and we found dinner in a little place up the street from the bazaar with great views and a wide range of traditional Albanian food. We went back to the hotel and listened to the thumping bass of the downstairs Irish bar until 11:30pm.\nFriday, August 11 Breakfast was great, but we had an encounter with bees. The kids could barely focus, and were waving their cutlery at the bees to scare them away, but just succeeded in flinging sweet sticky breakfast cake soaked in honey all over the table. Guess what bees love? It was kinda miserable after that, as swarms of bees progressively took over our table.\nWe did school in the morning on patio of the bar next to our room, then walked to a cafe halfway up to the castle. We came down afterwards instead of going to the castle just due to timing. We had some quiet time, then walked to the cold war bunker underneath the castle. It was a 30 minute tour, and we got to see a good portion of the bunker. Apparently some parts of it are in poor condition and have collapsed, but our section was \u0026ldquo;much stronger\u0026rdquo;. Still, neat to see evidence of Albania\u0026rsquo;s cold war past hasn\u0026rsquo;t all disappeared.\nWe attempted the castle afterwards, but changed course at the gate after realizing that the kids were worn out. Saying it was \u0026ldquo;closing\u0026rdquo;, we moved on straight to dinner at a little restaurant at the top of the hill, rather than go back down. Again, a bit of a debacle. They turned on the music videos on a giant screen facing our table right after we sat down, so the kids were entranced and had a tough time finding their mouths with their forks. We also had to eat inside, which was a bit hotter and nowhere to escape with a misbehaving kid.\nOne thing I will also say about Albania is that eating at a restaurant is a process. Dishes come out in ones and twos, and if you order a special dish, you should be prepared to wait 30-40 minutes. That\u0026rsquo;s not a problem, as many dishes come right away, but you have to plan for a full hour, which is not so easy to do with young kids.\nAfter dinner we walked to an aqueduct up the hill from our restaurant. It was a nice walk to do after dinner near dusk. Mom took Ben and Sam across, while I waited on the near side. I was not going to cross that bridge\u0026hellip; My arms were able to span it\u0026rsquo;s width! Mom came back and brought Max over in her arms and once we were back on the same side then we all walked back to the hotel.\nAfter the kids went to bed we went out on the patio; we could see the door to our room, but could also sit and enjoy a drink. We met a nice couple and chatted with them until about 11:30\u0026hellip;way too late! But still, it was fun and we don\u0026rsquo;t get enough of that.\nSaturday, August 12 Our breakfast was much better this morning because the host put us a little away from where the beast were swimming. We finished our honey soaked cake first and set the dishes aside. By the end of breakfast they had 30 bees swarming around them!\nAfter breakfast we did some school. We then packed our bags in order to move rooms in the hotel and then finally walked up to the castle. The Castle houses a bunch of old artillery that Ben was interested in. Getting up to the top of the castle, there were sheer drop offs with very few guardrails, as well as an old section that had obviously been part of a prison in more modern times.\nWe ate at the same place we had eaten on our first night in Gjirocaster. We tried a couple new things including the \u0026ldquo;big beans\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;. They were very good and we \u0026ldquo;fought\u0026rdquo; over them.\nAt dinner we ate near the bazaar and practiced various accents. Mom had the kids in stitches when trying to say \u0026ldquo;50 points from Gryffindor\u0026rdquo; in a Scottish accent.\nSunday, August 13 We ate breakfast, packed our bags, and said goodbye to our hosts at the hotel. The lady gave all the kids hugs. Sara drive out of the city a much easier way than we had come in on.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/11-gjirokaster/","tags":null,"title":"Gjirokaster, Albania"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The idea of this section of my website is to document some of my daily work during my sabbatical year and hopefully onward.

The trip was supposed to take 4 hours. Instead it took nearly seven, and for no specific reason other than traffic. traffic out in the middle of the countryside, traffic at a traffic circle, traffic into town. The whole route into Tirana from Podgorica is on what seems to be a local highway that the whole country uses to get North and South. There is no autostrada. Furthermore, the bus has to take the same route even if there\u0026rsquo;s a shorter path. to add insult to injury, Max said he had to pee before we even left the bus station. I had to run out the door with him to let him pee on a tire right before we left.\nThis just goes to say that travel days are hard. We made it into Tirana and quickly caught a cab to the airport to get our rental car. Albanian cash exchange does not take Bosnian currency, by the way.\nWe packed our things into our next vehicle and drove another two hours to our final destination that day, the town of Roshnik I Vogel, outside of Berat. The drive was scenic, and we kept getting glimpses of a lonely mountain sticking up in the distance. our route took us on quite small roads, with us passing the occasional donkey pulling a cart.\nWe got in close to 7, unloaded the car, and put the kids to bed. our destination was Alpeta winery, a charming little winery with restaurant tucked at the end of the road in town. Sara got a salad to supplement our relatively sparse \u0026ldquo;car dinner\u0026rdquo;, and we were pleasantly surprised at how lovely it was. we split a pitcher of their house wine and sat on the porch until bed. there was an engagement party going on, and I caught a glimpse of some traditional dancing under the arbor beneath the restaurant.\nTitle Monday, August 7, 2023 The next day was a school day. The kids worked in their journals on the deck and then moved to the terrace. We read outside all morning. We had breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the winery, all lovely. Before dinner I took the boys on a hike, where we found wild berries, a pair of tortoises, walnut trees, wild cherries\u0026hellip; and some great views.\nTuesday, August 8, 2023 We visited Berat on Tuesday. We parked and walked into town, grabbed a coffee in a cafe overlooking the park, and hiked up to the castle at the top of the hill. There views were great. There are the ruins of a mosque as well as an underground cistern, which looked like a chapel buried underground at the top of the hill and filled with water. Extraordinary! We had lunch up at the top and then hiked down a very sketchy, slippery path to the old town at the bottom. in search of gelato, we crossed two old bridges and toured both banks of the river. After ice cream we drove back to the winery, seemed the kids dinner and stayed for the wine tour, letting the kids stay in the room by themselves. It was worth it; we met some fun people and had some adult fun that has been rare on our trip.\nWednesday, August 9, 2023 The next day we hit the books early and hard. The reward after lunch was a hike with me, Ben, and Sam. We tried to follow a local trail but just ended up walking along the road, going above a nearby town that offered views of the winery and Tomorri mountain, the subject of most of my outdoor scenery photos.\nNature was on display during our hike. we saw three frogs, a jumping stick bug, a water snake, I caught a glimpse of a fox darting into the brush, and the kids found two more tortoises.\nOn our way back down the hill, am older man flagged use down on the road as he came out of his field carrying an armful of grapes. he thrust then at me, telling me in so much Albanian to give them to my kids. I tried to give them each a grape and he said no, and gave me the whole armful. We said thank you as he walked back to his field. We are grapes the rest of the way home.\nThis experience turned out to be quite typical during our time in Albania. The people are so friendly, giving, and joyful, especially around our kids. The servers would play with our kids in the restaurant or come over just to tousle their hair. The folks at the winery gave and got so many hugs from the kids, and clearly enjoyed them. Sam got a couple wasp stings and was surrounded by adults wanting to hold him, help, or comfort him.\nThursday, August 10, 2023 On our last morning at the winery the kids were invited to pick tomatoes with one of the farm workers.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/10-alpeta/","tags":null,"title":"Alpeta Winery, Albania"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Saturday, August 5, 2023 We left our lovely place in Lovcen and stopped by Lipa Cave, the first and only limestone cave open to the public since 2015.

We had fun descending down into the cave; Ben attempted to listen to the tour guide as she talked about the cave\u0026rsquo;s history and formations. Impressive.\nAfter the cave we drove to Podgorica and Sara dropped off the car. We stayed at the Hotel Evropa, a historic old hotel by the bus and train station. It obviously had once been a great hotel, but didn\u0026rsquo;t quite make as much sense any more. Still, the sheets were clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.\nWe walked around the center of town after a meaty lunch that I picked out, seeing an old bridge, the ruins of a castle, the old town and clock tower, and other neat features.

The border crossing took about an hour; about 20 minutes to leave Bosnia, and about 40 minutes to enter Montenegro. The checkpoints were about a mile or two apart. We attempted to go to the Ostrog Monastery, but the line of cars going up the hill \u0026ndash; on a one-lane road, on a Sunday \u0026ndash; was too daunting considering our passengers. We turned around and continued on, though we saw the monastery in the distance up along the cliff. Still cool.\nWe made it into Cetinje and headed out of town towards Lovcen National park, the site of our AirBnB. It took a while to find it due to some lagging communication but we eventually found it \u0026ndash; a lower floor apartment of a house that looks out upon fields and mountains. Gorgeous!\nWe walked next door to the hotel and spent 2.5 hours ordering coffee, beer, letting the kids jump on the trampoline and play on the swingset, and, afterwards having dinner. We walked up to the cafe up the hill for ice cream, then headed home. Travel days are long.\nMonday, July 31, 2023 Ben and sam woke up at about 6am hoping to play outside. We made them wait till 7 to keep from waking the neighbors. We had breakfast and the boys and I went on a 5-hour hike in the park. Mom drove us to the trailhead, and after hiking back a bit to give her back the house keys, we headed up into stands of beech trees, then some limestone Karst. We started seeing sinks, where the water obviously flows into the limestone, and started thinking about all the caves we must be walking over.\nI spotted one sinkhole with a gaping hole in the middle and investigated. Walking back to the trail I found wild strawberries; then Sam found raspberries! We stopped for a bit to eat them.\nIn and among the Karst, Sam found wild onions and we spotted some larger caves and crevices. Continuing on, I looked at the map and saw a cave \u0026ndash; slightly off the main trail but accessible in my opinion. We took an overgrown trail to it and slid down the slope to find the entrance. It was massive. The pictures don\u0026rsquo;t do it justice, but it was quite a deep hole. We scrambled back up and headed toward the town of Dolovi to meet Mom. Along the way, we turned a corner and found the coast, including the town of Radovici, Durasevici, Mrcevac, and Tivat, as well as an abandoned town. We continued on, finding mom in Dolovi, ate lunch at about 1, and headed back to the car. An amazing hike.\nAfter we got home, we read and did school outside for a while, then had an early dinner at the local pizza place. The kids played with a dog while we ordered. We ate fast, mom and the kids had ice cream, and we headed home where the boys played more.\nThis is a great place\u0026hellip;\nTuesday, August 1, 2023 We decided to take a windy road down to the town of Kotor, which is an ancient sea-port with lots of history. On the way down from the park, we hit the \u0026ldquo;serpentine\u0026rdquo;, a series of 16 back-to-back switchbacks on what can legally only be called a one-way road. Sara braved the cliffs, making it down without scraping off a single mirror. Good job mom!\nOn the way down, we stopped off at Gorazda Fortress, a much newer fort than all the old castles we\u0026rsquo;d seen so far. It was an old Austro-Hungarian outpost that had been repurposed over the years. One of the biggest \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo; of this fort was the extra large turret still mounted on the top of the fort. It was spooky, and relatively untouched, like the rest of the places we visited in Montenegro.\nGetting down to Kotor, we finally encountered the tourists again. I had already forgotton how glad I was to be away from them since Split. But there we were again, down low at sea level, back in the heat, tossed back into the meat grinder with all the cruise-ship crowds. Tour groups stretched across whole town squares as we jostled our way to a lunchtime table. We were hot, we were tired, but the city itself still kept some of its charm nonetheless. The city walls pop out all over the place, the town is easily explorable in an hour, but the nooks and crannies keep things interesting. We found that Montenegro, and Kotor to be the patron of many stray cats. The kids had fun petting ALL of them. We realized, as we were down there, that we would have to come back the next day to find Uncle Roy, so, due to the heat and our exhaustion from the drive and the heat and the fort, we left early, stopping by a grocery store and gas station to re-stock ourselves before going back to the park. Sara did a great job getting us back home through the serpentine yet again.\nWednesday, August 2, 2023 We decided to do Kotor a bit differently on Wednesday. Instead of have a lesiurely breakfast at the Hotel Monte Rosa, we got out early to beat the crowds, get a better parking spot, and \u0026ldquo;Do Kotor Right\u0026rdquo;. We were not prepared. There was a slight drizzle as we left, and thankfully we threw the rain jackets in the car as we left.\nMy rain jacket is from circa 2010, was starting to \u0026ldquo;delaminate\u0026rdquo;, and was not prepared. More on that later.\nAs we came down the hill for the second time in as many days, we saw a brilliant double rainbow. Don\u0026rsquo;t rainbows usually come out after the storm? Sara kept driving and things just got worse and worse. By the time we hit the serpentine, it was \u0026ldquo;spitting\u0026rdquo; rain; we pitied a couple hardcore cyclists in full panniers slowly rolling up the hill\u0026hellip;but I did not envy them that day.\nBy the time we got to Kotor, it was a full downpour. We got a good spot on the south side of town, within a couple blocks of the old town. Still, it was raining cats and dogs and our rain jackets \u0026ndash; jackets, not rain coats, mind you \u0026ndash; were in the trunk. Ben opened the trunk from the inside and we slowly donned our rain jackets and waited, and waited. Finally, I made the call\u0026hellip;it was time to go. We hopped out and 2 minutes later I was soaked from head to foot. The jacket did nothing but delay the water from coming in a bit.\nBy the time we got to the old town, our feet were waterlogged, my phone was on the fritz because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t use the touchscreen\u0026hellip;it was so wet! I took off the rain jacket and wrung it out. One of the shops was selling cheap vinyl rain jackets so I bought one for 10 Euro. We tried to hide under porticoes and arches, but we really had nowhere to go; all the outdoor cafes were shuttered and their tents put away.\nWe made ran through the town to the maritime museum and stripped off our wet jackets, hung them up, and went inside\u0026hellip;.and the lights were all off! The power was out, and so we waited inside, slowly letting the water drip out of every pore. The lights eventually came back on and we toured the museum for a while.\nOnce we were done with the museum we went back outside and the skies had cleared. We made our way toward the stairs up to the top of the Kotor fortress and hiked to the top; Ben counted 1,359 steps up. Great views!\nAfter we got down, we had lunch with Uncle Roy. It was great to see him and talk about our respective trips. After lunch we got gelato with him and saw him back to his tour group. We walked along the city walls, made it to a beach, and let the kids (and me) jump in the water for a bit. The water was not as warm as I would have wanted but was still refreshing. We made it home that night and ate at the hotel that night\u0026hellip;it had been a long day.\nThursday, August 3, 2023 In the morning, Mom took kids to hotel for coffee and trampoline while I worked. In the afternoon we continued \u0026ldquo;double potions\u0026rdquo; with extra reading, writing, and \u0026lsquo;rithmetic to make up for the last couple (wonderful) days off school.\nFriday, August 4, 2023 In the morning we hit school hard. Mid-morning I took the kids to the nearby hotel for coffee (for me) and trampoline (for them). In the afternoon we took the kids to an adventure park and visited a nearby mausoleum. Had a nice dinner outside and packed for our next travel day.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/08-lovcen/","tags":null,"title":"Lovcen National Park, Montenegro"},{"categories":null,"contents":"July 26 Our trip from Split to Treibinje took us over the border into Bosnia. The drive was pretty, with many relatively unpopulated vistas and old towns.\nI navigated us to the town of Pocitelj for lunch, which was a treat! We ate by the river and threw in some rocks after. The town features a medieval castle with still-standing tower, mosque, and ramparts. We hiked up past the mosque as the prayer call began. Nowhere else in our trip so far was the history as accessible, unsafe, and untouristed. There were maybe 15 people in the tower, no safety mechanisms of any kind, no tickets or regulation, and it was great!\nAfter lunch we took an alternate route around a lake, up a winding, single-lane highway, and along a rural route that was a converted railroad line overlooking a national park(link). I thought of my trip through eastern europe by bike, as this road was also a bike route. The route kept getting smaller and smaller! By the time we were a mile from the M6, the main route was closed and we were on a gravel road detour through a field. But we made it back to the M6 and sailed into Trebinje.\nJuly 27 We ate an early breakfast, walked into Trebinje\u0026rsquo;s old town, and had a coffee in a little cafe while the kids played in an alley.\nWe came home, did school, and I tried to work in the din.\nIn the late afternoon we walked to a pretty poor playground in a local neighborhood. The kids still needed it. We got some veggies and fruit, came home and made a wonderful salad for dinner.\nJuly 28 Mom took the kids to a monastery while I tried to play catch-up on my email and some long-standing issues with class prep. They picked me up around 10:45 and we headed to a winery where we tried some nice local wine and talked to a young woman about the wine, our travels, and her experiences in the US. It was pleasant. We looked for lunch at a second winery, with no luck. We headed home for lunch, did school, had some quiet time, and went out to dinner at \u0026ldquo;Market 99\u0026rdquo;, a nearby restaurant. We walked to a park carved out of the river and watched the kids play, walked home, got some popcorn, and headed to bed. A nice day.\nJuly 29 On our last day in Trebinje, we walked up to the Orthodox Church at the top of the hill overlooking Trebinje. It was hot. On our way down, we took an overgrown path and spotted a tortoise. Back at the apartment we did some school and Dad and Sam headed to the store to look for food for dinner and traveling the next day. I got some sausage that looked like ham, some more summer-sausagy looking thing, what I thought was ricotta or similar but just turned out to be butter, some cheese chunks, dried apricots, figs, dates, etc., and a lot of veggies and peaches\u0026hellip;I also got \u0026ldquo;flower\u0026rdquo; bread, which was 7 dinner-sized rolls (6 around, one in the middle).\nIn the afternoon, after reading and math we headed to the park and the kids played soccer with a dad and his son. We walked over to the old arch bridge, and then Mom met us with the car and we headed up out of town and hiked to an old tower. The stairs to the entrance were collapsed but we were able to climb up enough to look in\u0026hellip;there was a peephole and a doorway up to a higher level, and the ceiling on the first level was still intact, in the form of a bricked in dome. I invented \u0026ldquo;ham\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;butter\u0026rdquo; sandwiches; mom added cucumber and pepper to make it healthier. The kids loved them :)\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/07-trebinje/","tags":null,"title":"Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Saturday, July 22 I woke at 5am, and, looking out the porthole, saw land! We were at Croatia! We disembarked around 7am and burned some time in Split until our apartment opened around 2pm. Sara got food at the grocery store, and we relaxed.\nSunday, July 23 One of the places we had tried to go on Saturday was Diocletian\u0026rsquo;s palace. We arrived there to find the square filled with people, roman soldiers, tour groups\u0026hellip;there was nowhere to sit, stand, or breathe, and it had been so hot! So on Sunday morning we decided to try again. After an early bedtime the night before, we ate a quick breakfast and went back. It was empty! Apparently the ferries and cruise ships had not disembarked many tourists by ~8am.\nWe strolled around the whole palace area, with the place to ourselves. A favorite was the South gate, which has a subterranean exit to a lower town plaza and pier. This used to go straight to the water in Diocletian\u0026rsquo;s day.\nWe had a quick bite in a cafe, chatted with some actual locals, and went back home for school. We had a day inside for most of the rest of the morning.\nWe went to a local beach in the afternoon and I accidentally stepped on an urchin or two. I went home to pick glass out of my feet\nMonday, July 24 I took the kids out for a hike up the hill and into the park. We took in the sights from the overlook, the kids played in the playground, and I took them on a proper scramble down the back side of the hill in search of a cafe. We never made it; it was time for school and way to hot, so we headed home.\nWe went out for gelato in the evening and played go fish as a family before bed.\nTuesday, July 25 We got up early and headed into the palace area to catch up with a tour group that would take us to one of Croatia\u0026rsquo;s nearest national parks. When we got there it was cloudy and almost raining, a nice break from the heat. We walked around a set of preserved buildings that had once housed a hydroelectric plant installed by Tesla, that also looked like it had been a small town. Walking the boardwalk through the network of interconnected pools, streams, and waterfalls was neat, but way too overcrowded. We couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop, nor could we all get out to the crowded overlooks\u0026hellip;just too many people. By the time we finished the boardwalk it was lunchtime, hot, and overfull. Sara and the boys took the boat back to Skradin, the nearest town, while I walked the 3km just to get in a proper walk away from the crowds. It was lovely. We got back on the bus at 3:10 and headed back to Split\nWe had a nice dinner out near our apartment to celebrate Sam\u0026rsquo;s birthday. We shared two slices of chocolate cake and then let the kids run up the steps to the nearest hill and burn off the sugar and chocolate.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/06-split/","tags":null,"title":"Split, Croatia"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Thursday, July 20 We drove across the country to San Marino. Pretty uneventful, but one highlight was the many tunnels we went through. The kids slept most of the way.\nAs we got off the autostrada, we started heading up in elevation. As we kept going up, we realized that we were heading towards a cliff and a little mountain with a picturesque fortification on top. We kept assuming that we would turn off the road before we got to the top, but we truly made it within a couple hundred meters of the end of the road. We stayed at the Hotel Rosa, a picturesque, quaint, and quite pleasant hotel within the city walls of San Marino. After wrangling our cars through the crowd on the mostly pedestrian street, we walked around, Ben bought some Harry potter themed souviners, and we had another pizza dinner. It was a nice, calm, fun night. Erin bought Sam a candle for his birthday. We had more gelato. We tried more of the wine from Pisa and the wineries Sara and Erin had visited. It was a great night.\nFriday, July 21 We got up, had an outdoor breakfast at the hotel, and walked the three towers of San Marino. Amazing views! We headed back to the hotel, packed up, and said our goodbyes to Erin, Avery, and Hayden, and headed to Ancona. We were early, but the directions on our reservation indicated we had to be there quite early. I stayed with the kids while Sara returned the car at the airport and came back in a taxi. Sam and Max and I walked briefly to the (working) pier, looked at the fishing boats, looked at some fish in the water, walked to an island fortress, and headed back. After so much travel, it was a tough day again. We boarded a bus to the pier at 5:30, got in line, and finally started boarding a little after 6pm. The boat left after 8pm some time. We had hors d\u0026rsquo;ouvres and dinner on the boat and went to bed. The cabin was warm and stuffy, but bearable.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/05-san-marino/","tags":null,"title":"San Marino, San Marino"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Wednesday, July 19 We got off the ferry from Corsica and found a taxi-van right away. As we made our way towards the stazione, we looked at our train options. One was leaving at 7:04\u0026hellip;.and it was 6:45! The minutes ticked away as we made our way through Livorno. The taxi driver knew his way, but had picked side streets with lots of little cars entering and leaving the road. We made it to the station with about 6 minutes to spare. I jumped out of the taxi and ran to the ticket line. No one was in it! I got my tickets and ran back. The kids were down the stairs headed to platform 6. We were running. Up the stairs! Erin yelled it\u0026rsquo;s already here, and the sign is flashing! I recall Ben struggling to bring the big blue suitcase up the stairs. I briefly tried to help him, but a voice inside screamed, \u0026ldquo;Leave him, he\u0026rsquo;ll be fine!\u0026rdquo; I scooted around him to the top of the stairs and started chucking bags in the open door. It was probably 7:02. The kids made it to the top and immediately began piling into the car. It was a scrum. Kids were screaming, crying, and Ben lost his glasses under the train. Suddenly auntie Erin was on her knees groping under the platform. I yelled, \u0026ldquo;Leave them!\u0026rdquo; She said, \u0026ldquo;I can get them!\u0026rdquo; I scrambled down to help however I could, but she was already within reach. She got them, we threw the last of the children and bags on, and got on the train. Kids were crying, everyone was out of breath, sweat was streaming down my back. It was a scene. We slowly got our bags up on the racks, gave the kids some gummy crocodiles, and calmed down.\n25 minutes later we got off the station at Pisa and walked our way through town to our apartment. It was a fantastic old stately building that we had two separate apartments in. It was relaxing, cool, and well stocked for breakfast and drinks.\nWe dumped our things and headed out for dinner. It was ~8:30, we had had a really long travel day, and the kids had done a great job. But we were losing them. We found a close pizza place, ordered, ate, grabbed gelato, and headed back home. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t as fun as it should have been, considering the mini-celebration we could have had for such a long day, but I can\u0026rsquo;t blame the kids for how tired they should have been.\nWe made it home, showered and got the kids to bed. It was probably 9:30 to 10 before bedtime finished. They were crazy, but it was silent in about 5 minutes.\nErin met us in the front hallway for drinks. The wine they gave us for our stay was slightly bubbly and with no label\u0026hellip;our favorite! We went to bed later than I would have liked.\nThursday, July 20 We got going slower than we would have liked. Sara had grand plans to go to the pharmacy and restock our supply of sunscreen, but didn\u0026rsquo;t make it. Our check out time was 11; The kids got up and we got out around 9:30. We walked a couple blocks, turned the corner, and found the leaning tower. It was truly leaning! The crowds weren\u0026rsquo;t that bad. We walked around, got photos, and by the time we started back at 10:20, I was realizing we had to really get going. We got back to the apartment at 10:40, quickly packed, and the moms took a taxi to the airport and got rental cars. The kids and I found a cafe, sat ourselves down, and ordered:\n3 cannolis (pistachio, cream, and chocolate) a rice pudding pie a little mini pizza a salami sandwich some juices and lemonades a cappucino for myself After a bit of coaxing and reverse psychology, Hayden ate both the sandwich (with arugula and salami) as well as some bites of the pizza. I also got her to eat some of the rice pudding by saying that pudding was like warm ice cream, and that rice pudding was just vanilla pudding with rice in it\u0026hellip;.and that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want her to eat it. She ate it. The day heated up, we finished our food, and the girls came back just in time. We got in two cars and headed out of town.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/04-pisa/","tags":null,"title":"Pisa, Italy"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Friday, July 14, 2023 We left our apartment around 7am, traveled from Genoa to Livorno by train, and then took a ferry from Livorno to Bastia, Corsica. Erin arrived around 11:45, which was pretty tight for getting there by 1pm, and supposedly around a 40 minute walk (it would have been double that for our family, especially in the heat). So we waited by the taxi stall and a taxi-van arrived just in time. There are two different ferry docks in Livorno, which can get confusing. Luckily, we went to the (correct) Corsica Ferry pier, and our driver found our boat for us. It couldn\u0026rsquo;t have been smoother, but what if anything had gone wrong?\nThe ferry ride was nice, and it was nice in retrospect to have had a cabin. We were able to dump our bags in there, and had we needed it, we could have even taken a shower! But I put the bags in the shower instead, so that was off limits.\nBen made a good point that we used a lot of different modes of transportation on our way to Corsica:\nWalk to train station Train to Livorno Taxi to Ferry Ferry to Bastia Taxi to Airport Rental Car to Calvi We found our AirBNB pretty easily. Again, the host didn\u0026rsquo;t reveal the true location until we were already in Calvi. Is this the new normal? If so, it is an annoying normal. Erin and I walked into town to look for food, got pizzas and wine, brought them back, and had a short and fast dinner before bed.\nSaturday, July 15 Sara and Erin took the kids to the beach while I caught up on work. The kids came home for lunch and had a 3-hour quiet time, which everyone needed.\nAfter that, the kids got to watch a \u0026ldquo;Wild Kratts\u0026rdquo; while Sara and I headed to the store. We all ate pasta for dinner, and the kids went to bed early after playing some badminton in the back driveway.\nSome times we need a rebuilding day.\nSunday, July 16 The day got going slowly. The kids in the bunkroom all got up earlier, but I woke later. Sara and Erin took the kids to a slightly further beach; I still need to catch up on finishing dissertation edits; approval is due tomorrow!\nWe went to a restaurant along the coast. It was a 30 minute drive on a barely-maintained stretch of winding road. Google told me the speed limit was 80 km/h, but we rarely got over 45.\nDinner was excellent in the end, but it got off to a rough start.\nThe kids all got \u0026ldquo;lemonade\u0026rdquo;, but limonata is fizzy here. That was a no-go for our boys. So we re-ordered juices for the kids. We were the first ones there, which meant that when we got our food, all the bees around the restaurant swarmed us and our food. They brought out a \u0026ldquo;smoke pot\u0026rdquo; to keep them away, and slowly the bees migrated to other tables as their food came too.\nAfter the kids ate, they walked around the restaurant and explored while the adults finished their food and relaxed, finally.\nWe got some great photos at sunset by the ocean.\nSara and Erin snuck out after the kids went to bed for an evening drink together.\nMonday, July 17 Sara woke up early for a run. After breakfast, Ben, Avery, Sam and I walked to the citadel in the morning while the moms drove the younger ones. We met them in a playground and then walked up into the citadel. The old town in the citadel is occupied by residents, and had a lived-in feel. We found some great views and watched an artisan in his shop show Ben and Sam how he makes his knives from steel bar stock and a ram\u0026rsquo;s horn (for the handle). He talked the kids through the process while I interpreted (really I just told the kids what I already know about the process as I loosely followed his words), and then we watched him assemble a blade to the handle. He cut a small metal shaft and smoothed it with a gr to make a pin, inserted it into the handle and attched the blade, put on two brass washers, and pounded it all in with a small hammer. He was very generous with his time; I would have bought a knive, but it was 120 Euros.\nI bought the kids gelato while the moms drank coffees at a cafe. Big hit.\nThe big kids and I then walked back to the apartment and we all had lunch there. We then made our way to the beach and had a relaxing afternoon at the beach. We all swam out past the rock wall and dived in ~8 foot water. We saw two sea stars, played in the shallow water, and I got a nice burn (though I didn\u0026rsquo;t know it yet). We ended our beach afternoon at the beach bar \u0026amp; restaurant. We had crepes (finally) and drinks and used the WC.\nSara and I snuck out ourselves and walked into \u0026ldquo;downtown\u0026rdquo; Calvi and found the quay. There were probably 2000 people all having dinner by the docks. Just as we arrived, some fireworks started. We finally found a wine bar near the end of the quay. After one drink we were exhausted, and walked home in the dark.\nTuesday July 18 The last full day of our time in Corsica, we had to split up. I stayed at the apartment with Sam while he and I sorted out some issues, while Sara and Erin and the rest of the kids went to a winery. Sam and I got ourselves sorted out (calmed down, folded laundry, and did some journaling) and then we walked into town to the nearest train station. We tried asking some folks where to buy tickets and got different answers. The first lady pointed us to a ticket machine\u0026hellip;for the parking lot. The second couple told us we needed to buy tickets IN Calvi, which didn\u0026rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense. But since it was 10 minutes till the train came, Sam and I had a chance to make it to the next stop down, at the end of the line in \u0026ldquo;downtown\u0026rdquo; Calvi. We ran as fast as we could and Sam kept up well. We made it to the next station with 3-4 minutes to spare, asked someone at the information booth where to buy tickets and she said, \u0026ldquo;dans le tren\u0026rdquo;, which means \u0026ldquo;on the train\u0026rdquo;. So we had worn ourselves out for nothing. We hopped on the very hot train and at the end of the day, the conductor was not able to process my credit card, so he just let us go. What a ride. We got off the train about 5 stops away near the second beach everyone had gone to on Sunday, but this time with a reservation at the restaurant. We had some great food. Octopus, tuna tartare, two risottos, fish, a fancy burrata plate. It was really good. We proceeded to the beach after lunch; I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember my swim trunks and didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to expose myself to the sun again, so I hid under the umbrellas. Sam had to go home early because he wasn\u0026rsquo;t listening; we lost a pair of shoes (we think) in the melee. Sam recovered again, but we were really tired. After reading to the kids and mom at bedtime, the adults opened one of the bottles from the winery and packed and did laundry and chatted until bedtime.\nWednesday, July 19 We got going earlier on our last day in Corsica. We cleaned and packed and had a bit of a \u0026ldquo;discussion\u0026rdquo; with our host as we checked out\u0026hellip;.more on that later. We had a bit of a drive to return the cars and get to the ferry by 2. Our drive took about two hours, and we stopped once at an old bridge. The history of the area was described in a little park nearby, which seemed to be at the center of the Corsican indpendence movement as well.\nWe drove towards the airport, got gas, and then decided to take the train back in to Bastia from there. The two taxis on the way to the airport in the other direction had cost 70 Euros each! The moms took the cars back, while I waited with the kids in the station, got tickets, filled waters, consolidated our packs, and waited for the train. The girls got back with about 10 minutes to spare from the airport in a taxi after dropping off the cars. We met the train, loaded up our baggage, and went 11 stops into the town. Once in town, we walked down to the south ferry station, realized that we needed to enter at the north ferry station, and walked in the blazing heat under no shade in the bright sun. I sweated out the shirt I was wearing out that I had stayed relatively cool in up to that point.\nThis embarkment was a bit different\u0026hellip;full security! We had to remove our laptops, scan all the luggage, and show our passports, which was difficult for 3 adults and 5 kids to switch into doing quickly. We caught the last shuttle to the ferry, walked on, and tried to find any place to sit. This time, Sara had not gotten a cabin, nor even seats (we didn\u0026rsquo;t know our tickets didn\u0026rsquo;t imply seats). So after some rearranging, we found a big round table in the cafeteria area that a woman had just vacated, got a lot of fried food, and slowly recovered from our morning on the move. It was 2:45pm as we finished lunch. The panic subsided and the adults all wanted to fall asleep.\nA cute thing that happened was that I noticed an older man doodling on the back of a cafeteria tray liner. I brought Sam over and told him Sam was an artist, and he gave Sam his drawing,and even signed it! Sam got out his sketch book and showed the man his drawings, and then drew something for him, and gave it to him. It was a nice moment.\nThis was half our journey to Pisa\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/03-corsica/","tags":null,"title":"Corsica, France"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Monday July 10th We woke up and packed our bags in preparation for checking out. Our Airbnb hosts met us at 9:45 and offered to take some of our bags down to the bus stop. It had been a very pleasant stay and that act of generosity was much appreciated\nI went with the car, and when Sara and the kids arrived down the hill she asked, \u0026ldquo;did you bring the sandwiches?\u0026rdquo; We looked at each other, and after looking at the bus schedule she ran back up the hill and returned just as our bus was getting ready to go. So much for staying cool.\nWe made it to the train station and couldn\u0026rsquo;t get on the first train, but the second one was only 15 minutes behind. We switched to an Italian train in Ventmiglia. The Italian train was off when we got on and incredibly hot. It took one full stop before the electricity came on and the AC started to run. The ticket machine was not taking my credit cards, so I was almost late returning to our new train.\nI also tested how well my international phone plan worked as we cross the border. After restarting my phone it clicked into Italian service with no problems.\nWe knew we had to switch trains in Savona, so we got off the first train, headed down the stairs to cross to another track, looked at the monitors and realized\u0026hellip;.we had to go back to the same track! By the time we got back up, the train (same? different? We never really figured it out.) was ready to leave. The AC in the car we picked was dead, so we baked all the way in to Genoa.\nOnce we left the train in Genoa, we decided to hoof it to our place, which was a \u0026ldquo;19 minute walk\u0026rdquo; according to Google. It took a little longer, but the boys picked that because we threw in Gelato if they walked. We went along a very small street nearly the whole way there, staying out of the direct sun. It was still brutal, and we saw some interesting sights (brothel?), but we made it to our place, with a gelato place right across the square!\nBen and I had dinner to ourselves. I had an octopus \u0026ldquo;burger\u0026rdquo;, and Ben had a salmon sandwich. He did not like the coke I bought him. We met up with Anson, who found us as we got our food. Ben was super excited to hear the bell at 6pm and to realize that he could actually see the bell swinging!\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about our Genoa AirBNB. This place is precisely what is bad about Airbnb these days. It\u0026rsquo;s managed by an impersonal management company that has no flexibility, and is doing the most it can to do the least work possible. They manage your check-in, arrival, and messaging through their own independent portal, including a requirement for you to scan all your passports. I don\u0026rsquo;t really want scans of our passports just sitting out there on the web on some random third-party server, so I had to spend extra time to watermark all the images before uploading them.\nSome preliminary issues They don\u0026rsquo;t give you location or check-in information until two and a half hours before check in. We were traveling for the first couple days without a SIM and so it would have been difficult to get the instructions in the morning before we left. The key to the place requires Wi-Fi which for an international traveler may not be easy to get either. Their correspondence with us has been overly commercial, trying to hook us into the other services divided by them or their \u0026ldquo;partners\u0026rdquo; And this was before we even got there!\nOther Problems Other things we found out after we arrived\nMold on bathroom wall various internet services were blocked: whatsapp github google voice the pictures from AirBNB were old and not reflective of the current state of the place The instructions for entering the apartment were not clear. no soap provided. No A/C (which was not necessarily expected, but it was really uncomfortable) The french windows with the built-in seats below them are quite dangerous for the young ones. No salt and pepper, or any condiments. EVERY AirBNB has salt and pepper, cmon! Tuesday, July 11 First day of the conference. Mostly bio-related talks. Met up with my PhD advisor, Mark, for lunch. Talked tech, sabbatical, and other fun stuff. Got a behind-the-scenes tour of the Aquarium where the conference was held. We got to see lots of tanks. The welcome reception was really nice, but outside, and really hot. Sounds like mom and the kids had a blast in cinque terra.\nWednesday, July 12 Day 2 of the conference was great. The focus of the day was more robotics related. Oussama Khatib presented after lunch on Ocean 1K, and Anson presented his work right after; his presentation went well! We got coffee and met Sara and the kids for gelato. Anson and his sister then walked around with me and the kids for a bit, took pictures by the fountain, and then I headed back to the conference for the banquet.\nSomething I learned today: \u0026ldquo;A working principle is a disposition\u0026rdquo;. For more information, I suggest you read the paper.\nThe banquet was at an impressive estate that appears to be a wedding venue. There were drinks and appetizers, some vocalists sang, dinner, dessert, and then dancing. I went home after dessert, which was served around 10:45, after talking to Nick and Mike.\nSurprisingly, it rained overnight.\nThursday, July 13 The last day of the conference went quickly. Kyujin Cho spoke first, and Olga Speck had a plenary talk after lunch. Both were great, and I particularly liked learning about the \u0026ldquo;biomechanics of plants\u0026rdquo;. Something I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought much about, but has a lot of relevance to some of my teaching.\nWe went to dinner that night as a family. It was a bit difficult, as the kids had not had the restful day I had hoped for. They went to the kids museum and played hard, for far too long\u0026hellip;but enjoyed it. I got home and had to deal with discipline issues from tired kids before we could go out. Sara walked them around so I could get 45 minutes of work in before dinner. I met them there, and we gobbled up 3 dishes and 2 appetizers.\nWe packed that night after a fun and interesting trip to Genoa, in preparation for a busy travel day to Corsica.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/02-genoa/","tags":null,"title":"Genoa, Italy"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Friday, July 7 We arrived Friday morning in Frankfurt. Sara didn\u0026rsquo;t sleep much at all. I got a bit of sleep. but we\u0026rsquo;re talking maybe 1-2 hours? The kids were zombies when they had to leave the plane.\nBecause our flight had been delayed, we had a relatively tight connection, which required us to deplane, enter customs, re-enter security, and switch terminals. All went ok, though if anything hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone well we would have been in more trouble. There was some confusion as to which terminal / gate our plane was in. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get coffee before the flight :(\nBen slept on the second leg, which was a relatively short trip to Nice.\nWe arrived in Nice minus Sam\u0026rsquo;s bag. The AirBNB doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a street number so we are hopeful that it will arrive here safely the next day. They apparently found it.\nWe got our internet working and before we collapsed, went down to the port to meet up with Mark and Shayna. They have been here over 2 weeks, and were able to orient us pretty quickly. We got a quick drink / snack, found some gelato for the kids, got tickets for the bus, identified the famous free sparkling water station, and took a bus back to our AirBNB, where we collapsed pretty quickly at 6pm.\nIt was a really windy day, but hot, and there was some debate in my mind whether we should use the A/C or leave the windows open. The AirBNB Host said there could be mosquitos, but we kept them open anyways. I may have gotten some bug bites and probably didn\u0026rsquo;t sleep as well, but I did sleep 12 hours.\nSaturday, July 8 We walked the city with Mark and Shayna across the whole day. The map above spells out our route. Some features included:\nHiking up to the Fort Alban and walking around it A secret walkway down to the city A children\u0026rsquo;s park Taking the tram to Mark and Shayna\u0026rsquo;s apartment The fountains where the kids played in the water Our walk through the Vielle Ville, then along the quay towards the port We ended with dinner al fresco at our place. The kids stayed up late.\nSunday July 9th On our second full Day in Nice, we went to Monaco. Mark and Shayna stayed in Nice for the day\u0026hellip;we had worn them out the day before. We walked down from our house to Villefranche Sur Mer, and hopped on the bus (I had to run back up to get the bus tickets). We walked along the Esplanade, visited Le Marche de la Condamine where we drank coffees in the plaza and had lunch. We then walked up to the palace and vielle ville, walked through an exotic garden on a path high on a cliff above the sea, wound our way down to a secret beach(that was closed), and had a dip in the ocean along a concrete pier at Solarium Beach. The water felt great, but without life jackets, the big waves and deep water were too dangerous for more than one kid to be in the water at a time. We walked through the vielle ville on our way back and each got a gelato. On our way back, we took the local train.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/01-nice/","tags":null,"title":"Nice, France"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Monday June 26th Headed to Minneapolis from Phoenix with Dan, Ben, Sam, and Max. Mom finished up picking up the house, cleaning, and washing the walls, while we headed to Aunt Alison and Nick\u0026rsquo;s.\nTuesday June 27th We went to Lucy lake, did some paddle boarding. stayed with max for the second round of paddle boarding while he played in the sand and we share an ice cream sandwich met up with Mike Stern and Katrina and family at a local brewery, had empanadas and tacos.\nWednesday June 28th I caught up on a little work, reading Yuhao\u0026rsquo;s thesis in the morning. took the kids to the park. Sammy had to come home early. Kids had an attempted water fight but it was a fractious affair. I cooked sausages and corn on the grill.\nThursday June 29th We went to lake Minnewashta in the morning, walked around a little bit by myself, pushed the kids in the swing, walked around, came back home for lunch, had a proper water fight with more and better water blasters, then had burgers and watched big hero six.\nFriday, June 30 Spent the morning at home, walked to the park, had a water blaster fight, did the slip and slide, read about the Marauders map, had tacos and a fire after dinner with s\u0026rsquo;mores and ghost stories.\nSaturday July 1st started the morning off with pancakes. headed to the lake around 11:00 and stayed most of the afternoon. came home, let the kids play in the basement, began a new book, had pizza and finished Big hero 6. Sara got in late.\nSunday July 2nd We went to the pancake house for breakfast, came home, relaxed, and went to family night a)t the carnival.\nMonday, July 3rd We went to the lake all day, came home for a break, and went on an evening cruise on lake Minnetonka.\nTuesday, July 4 We went to the fourth of July parade. We lit fireworks at home, and while captain nuclear was underwhelming, the flaming frog was great. We went to the fireworks overlooking Lake Minnetonka in Excelsior, and made it home quite late.\nWednesday, July 5 Today was a recovery day; everyone slept in. Sara and I worked, the kids played and watched some \u0026ldquo;octonauts\u0026rdquo; so we could begin preparing for our trip, and we endured a rough patch with Sam \u0026amp; August because they were so tired. Made some major headway on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban though! Ate BBQ from Buddy Boy. Sara taught the kids how to blow bubbles with bubble gum.\nThursday, July 6 Last day in Minnesota. Final Packing, final syncing of computers (took longer than I would have hoped). The kids played well most of the day, we ate leftovers, and generally took it easy. Blew bubbles.\nHeaded to the airport around 3pm. It was rough for the kids, especially Astrid.\nCheckin, security, and boarding went relatively smoothly. Our carrier was Condor, and there was a bit of a panic as to whether we would actually be fed on the plane or if we would need to buy our own overpriced snacks. Fortunately, dinner and breakfast was included!\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/travel/00-minnesota/","tags":null,"title":"Pre-Trip to Minnesota"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter plus more for baking dish 1 pound good-quality day-old white bread, torn into 1\u0026quot; pieces (about 10 cups) 2 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions 1 1/2 cups 1/4\u0026quot; slices celery 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided 2 large eggs Directions Preheat oven to 250°F.

The tender texture, fun factor and comforting flavors of these healthy bites is not.\nIngredients 1 Tablespoon Butter 1 cup Finely Chopped Yellow Onion 2 cups Finely Chopped Green Swiss Chard Or Spinach Leaves (not Packed) 4 cups Finely Chopped Green Or Black Kale Leaves (not Packed) ½ teaspoons Fine Sea Salt Granules 4 whole Scallions (white And Light Green Parts), Minced ½ cups Panko Dry Bread Crumbs ½ cups Finely Grated Parmesan Cheese (plus An Extra 1 To 2 Tablespoons, For Baking) ¼ teaspoons Grated Nutmeg 2 Tablespoons Prepared Green Pesto (homemade Or Store Bought) ¾ teaspoons Ground White Pepper 2 whole Large Eggs 1 whole Lemon, Cut Into Wedges (optional, For Serving) Directions Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, then add onions and cook until just softened but not brown, about 10 minutes. Add greens and half of the salt and continue to cook and stir until completely wilted, another 10 minutes, keeping heat low enough so onions do not brown. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Stir in scallions, panko, Parmesan, nutmeg, and pesto. Taste mixture (before adding eggs) and season, starting with ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and adjusting to taste (I used ¾ teaspoon pepper and the flavor was quite prominent, if you’re into lots of pepper). Stir in eggs, breaking up yolks and combining completely into a uniform mixture. Heat oven to 375 F (if baking immediately) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the mixture into balls of 1½ tablespoons each and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle the top of each ball with a pinch of grated Parmesan. To bake immediately: Bake about 20 minutes in the upper third of the oven, until completely cooked through (no liquid egg inside) and browned on the bottom. When done, the puffs will spring back when squeezed lightly. To freeze: Place the un-baked tray of balls in the freezer, covered loosely with plastic wrap, until balls are frozen through, about 2 hours. Remove balls from sheet and store in a freezer bag or another airtight, freezer safe container. To bake, follow directions above. Thawing not necessary—just add 5 minutes to the cook time above (25 minutes total). Notes: Makes 20 puffs, about 4 to 6 appetizer servings. I think these would be a really fun brunch appetizer! In testing, I used Swiss chard and green kale (the fluffy, curly one). If substituting other varieties of greens, use something mild and tender in place of the chard or spinach, and something sturdy, and possibly slightly bitter, in place of the kale. Refrigerating the mixture (right in the pan; for 15 to 30 minutes) before forming balls helps it to firm up, making it even easier to handle. I tried it warm and refrigerated, without issues either way. If making for a strict vegetarian, make sure the pesto and Parmesan do not contain animal rennet. Varieties that work will likely be labeled “vegetarian”.

Gently fold the berries until they are all well coated with sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes. Roll out bottom crust: Preheat oven to 400°F. You should have two balls of pie dough, one for the bottom crust, one for the top crust. Roll out one of the balls of pie dough on a lightly floured surface to 12-inch diameter if you are using a 9-inch pie pan, or 13-inch diameter if you are using a 10-inch pan. Line the bottom of your pie pan with the dough. Chill in refrigerator while you roll out the top crust. Roll out top crust: Roll out the second ball of pie dough for the top crust. If you would like to do a lattice top, weave the dough strips as described in How to Make a Lattice Top for a Pie Crust. Spoon berry mixture into pie crust, top with second crust: Spoon the berry mixture into the dough-lined pie dish. For a lattice top, weave strips of pie dough over the top of the fruit-filled pie dish. For a solid top, place the second rolled-out pie dough crust on top of the pie. Press ends of strips into the rim of the bottom crust. Use scissors to trim the edges to 1/2-inch from the outer edge of the pie pan. Fold the edges back over themselves and use your fingers to crimp to seal the edges. If you are using a solid top crust, score the top several times with a sharp knife to create air vents for the steam to escape. Bake: Place the pie on the middle rack of the oven. Put a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any juices that might bubble out of the pie while it\u0026rsquo;s cooking. Bake the pie in two stages. First bake it at 400°F for 30 minutes. Then place a sheet of aluminum foil over the pie to protect the edges and tops from getting too burnt. (A pie protector is quite useful here.) Reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until the crust has browned and the filling is bubbly. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack. Cool completely before serving.

As soon as it turns to sort-of-dough consistency, dump it on your counter and work it with your hands. (Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to keep adding flour.) Yup, now it finally looks like dough!

The big ones are being cooked whole and then sliced to go with foods like Goulash :) Wrap it up in foil to freeze it, or you can cook it and eat it or freeze it. Because of the differences in flour, it\u0026rsquo;s better to cook it in the foil, so it keeps the right shape.

Gently stir to wash the figs, then drain off the water and rinse the figs thoroughly with fresh cool water. Place the figs into a large pot. Add 1 cup water, sugar, butter, vanilla extract, lemon, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Very gently stir the mixture to dissolve the sugar, keeping the figs intact as much as possible. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the figs are golden brown and coated in syrup, about 1 hour. Stir gently a couple of times to keep the figs from burning onto the bottom of the pot. Add a pinch of salt, if desired, to tame the sweetness. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the figs into the hot, sterilized jars and top off with syrup, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening. Place the whole figs in the pot, and let them break apart naturally, do not cut them in half. If you do not seal jars in boiling water, the mixture must be eaten in 30 days.

Don\u0026rsquo;t let the water and butter boil away while you grate the cheese. Second is to let the batter cool for a few minutes before adding the eggs so you don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;cook\u0026rsquo; them. Make sure when you stir in the eggs that you do it vigorously. 1. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Heat the water, butter, salt, and chile in a saucepan until the butter is melted. 3. Dump in the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the mixture pulls away from the sides into a smooth ball. Remove from heat and let rest two minutes. 4. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring quickly to make sure the eggs don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;cook.\u0026rsquo; The batter will first appear lumpy, but it will smooth out. 5. Add about 3/4s of the grated cheese and the chives, and stir until well-mixed. 6. Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag pipe the dough into mounds, evenly-spaced apart, making each about the size of a small cherry tomato. 7. Top each puff with a bit of the remaining cheese, then pop the baking sheet in the oven. 8. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375F (190C) and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until they\u0026rsquo;re completely golden brown. Serving: The puffs are best served warm, and if making them in advance, you can simply pipe the gougères on baking sheets and cook right before your guests arrive, or reheat the baked cheese puffs in a low oven for 5-10 minutes before serving. A bit of troubleshooting: The problem folks have with pâte à choux is them being deflated. The usual causes are too much liquid (eggs), or underbaking. Make sure to use large eggs, not extra-large or jumbo. And bake the puffs until they\u0026rsquo;re completely browned up the sides so they don\u0026rsquo;t sink when cooling.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/french-cheese-puffs/","tags":null,"title":"French Cheese Puffs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients Sesame Noodles 1 lb spaghettini (get the thinnest spaghetti you can find) 1⁄2 cup soy sauce 1⁄4 cup sesame oil (some reviewers have said that 1/2 cup of oil is too much and have halved the amount, so use your own) 1⁄3 cup sugar 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1⁄4 cup sesame seeds (or more)\nFunkey Chicken 1⁄4 cup soy sauce 1⁄4 cup teriyaki sauce 2 garlic cloves, minced 1⁄4 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, chopped (or 1/4 teaspoon dried) 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts sesame oil, for sauteing\nDirections First make the sesame noodles: Cook the spaghetti according to package directions.

Put all the ingredients into a baking pan large enough to hold them. Season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Make sure your hands are very clean and put them in the pan and give everything a toss to distribute. The garlic will drop into the water/oil solution but its flavour will permeate the potatoes, and this way, it won\u0026rsquo;t burn. Bake for 40 minutes. When a nice golden-brown crust has formed on the potatoes, give them a stir to bring the white underside up, season lightly with a bit more sea salt and pepper and just a light sprinkling of oregano. Add 1/2 cup more water if pan appears to be getting dry, and pop back into oven to brown other side of potatoes. This will take about another 40 minutes. Do not be afraid of overcooking the potatoes- they will be delicious. Note: I often melt a bouillon cube in the water; if you do, make sure to cut back some on the salt.

To reheat, wrap them in foil and warm in a 200 degree oven.\nCrepes Bring 2 Tbsp water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat; add 6 tablespoons butter, a little at a time, whisking until butter is completely melted. Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, vanilla, and eggs. Gradually add milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking until smooth. Whisk in butter mixture. Pour batter through a fine sieve into a bowl; discard lumps. Transfer batter to an airtight container; refrigerate at least 2 hours (or overnight). Preheat oven to 200 deg. Lightly coat a 6-7 inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet with melted butter. Heat over medium heat until just starting to smoke. Remove pan from heat; pour 2 to 3 tablespoons batter (depending on size of pan) in center. Swirl to cover bottom. Reduce heat to medium-low; return pan to heat. Cook until edges of crepe turn golden and center is dry, about 45 seconds. Flip crepe; cook until underside is brown in spots, about 45 seconds more. Slide crepe onto an ovenproof plate; cover with foil and transfer to oven. Repeat process with remaining batter, coating pan with more butter as needed. Fold each crepe into quarters to form a triangle. Arrange 3 crepes on each plate; drizzle with lemon-caramel sauce and garnish with candied lemon slices. Lemon-Caramel Sauce The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to three days. Gently reheat it just before serving.\nHeat sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved and syrup is clear. Continue to cook, without stirring, until syrup comes to a boil, occasionally washing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystals from forming. Let syrup boil, gently swirling pan occasionally, until dark amber. Remove from heat; whisk in lemon juice, liqueur, butter, and 2 tablespoons water. (Caramel will steam and spatter) Serve warm Candied Lemon Slices The lemon slices can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to one day\nPrepare an ice-water bath; set aside. Using a mandolin or sharp knife, cut lemon into 12 paper-thin slices; discard seeds and ends of rind. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, and add lemon slices; stir until softened, about 1 minute. Drain, and immediately plunge slices into ice-water bath. Drain. Bring sugar and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium skillet, swirling to dissolve sugar. When liquid is clear and bubbling, reduce heat to medium-low. Add lemon slices, arranging them in one layer with tongs. Simmer (do not let boil) until rinds are translucent, about 1 hour. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment.

It does a great job of waking up the other things it’s served with – a few spoonfuls of this next to a grilled chicken breast or pork chop would be an absolute celebration. Veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus. Basically whatever’s in season and available should be a nice addition. The easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin. If you don’t have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely. Shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles. Put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander. Mix everything together really well, then kick up the flavours by adding almost all the chopped chilli, the sliced red onion and a good few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Add most of the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt, then toss together and have a taste. Just keep adjusting everything, adding more fragrance with the coriander, heat with the last of the chilli and acid with another squeeze of lime juice, until it’s just right for you. When you’re happy, fold in the red cabbage right before serving so it doesn’t stain everything, and tuck in.

In large saucepan combine first 5 ingredients. Stir over low heat until blended. Increase heat to medium and bring to a full-rolling boil being careful not to mistake escaping air bubbles for boiling. Boil slowly, stirring constantly, 3½ – 5 minutes to the soft ball stage*. Remove from heat, stir in semi-sweet chocolate pieces until they are melted. Stir in vanilla. Add nuts. Turn into greased pan and cool. Makes 2½ pounds.\n*The soft ball stage is a test to see if the fudge has been cooked to the proper stage. Before you start cooking, fill a small dish with ice water and set aside. After you have brought the recipe to a full boil for 3½ minutes, dribble a few drops of the mixture into the ice water from a wooden spoon. After it cools in the water (about 10 seconds), you should be able to roll it into small ball with your finger tips. If you put it in your mouth, it will be slightly chewy. If it passes these tests, you are done and should remove the mixture from heat and add the remaining ingredients. Otherwise, cook for another 30 seconds and try the test again. Most of the time, cooking time will not exceed 5 minutes.\nHint: As with all fudge recipes, cooking time will vary depending on factors such as humidity, altitude, and cooktop temperature.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/never-fail-fudge/","tags":null,"title":"Never Fail Fudge"},{"categories":null,"contents":"docker-compose version: \u0026#39;2\u0026#39;

Add the milk, honey and egg white, stirring with a flexible spatula until smooth, about 5 minutes. The dough will be fairly wet but elastic, and will start to come together into a ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a plate (or transfer to a lidded container) and set aside at room temperature (70 degrees) for 4 to 5 hours, until the dough is spongy, light and has more than doubled in size. (The timing is flexible depending on your schedule.)\nGenerously cover a large, rimmed baking sheet with an even layer of cornmeal (you may use about half to three-quarters of it). With a large spoon, dollop out a dozen 2 2/3-ounce (75 grams) portions of dough; it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine to do this by eye. If you\u0026rsquo;d like, pinch the irregular blobs with slightly dampened fingers to tidy their shape. Sprinkle with additional cornmeal, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 12 to 48 hours.\nHeat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. (If you have an electric griddle, preheat it to 325 degrees.) When it\u0026rsquo;s sizzling-hot (check by sprinkling a few small drops of water), add half the butter and melt. Griddle the muffins until their bottoms are golden brown, about 8 minutes, rotating each muffin 180 degrees halfway through so the outer edges are moved to the center for even browning. Flip with a square-end spatula and griddle until the other side is golden brown as well. Depending on the size of your skillet or griddle, you may have to cook the muffins in batches, adding 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet each time. Transfer the muffins to a wire rack until cool enough to handle, then split the muffins by working your thumbs around the edges to pull them open a little at a time.

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.; Hot Water Dough In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long \u0026rsquo;noodle\u0026rsquo;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. MAKING THE DUMPLINGS: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. COOKING THE DUMPLINGS In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. SPICY SOY DIPPING SAUCE: Combine all and serve in a small bowl. Plating Serve pot stickers on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/pork-and-ginger-pot-stickers/","tags":null,"title":"Pork and Ginger Pot Stickers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This recipe from a story on chili-style dishes from around the world is one of those things that people just can’t stop eating; friends have been known to have thirds and then smile with slight embarrassment and serve themselves some more. Part of its appeal is that it smells so good while it’s cooking \u0026ndash; the combination of garlic, pork, orange juice and dark beer is extremely potent. It’s good served over rice or in bowls with corn bread on the side.\nIngredients 1 cup orange juice 1 (12-ounce) bottle dark beer 1 pound tomatillos, papery husks removed, quartered 1/4 cup peanut oil 1 head garlic, peeled 2 pounds boneless pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes Salt, pepper 2 large onions, thinly sliced 2 pounds Roma tomatoes, chopped 3 jalapeno chiles, diced 1 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper, or more to taste 1 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped 1 (1-pound) can black beans with liquid or 1 1/2 cups homemade cooked black beans with liquid Cooked rice 1* /2 avocado, peeled and sliced Cilantro sprigs Lime Sour Cream Directions Combine orange juice, beer and tomatillos in large saucepan. Cook over medium heat about 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat peanut oil in large skillet. Add garlic cloves and cook 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 of cubed pork and season to taste with salt and pepper. Brown pork on all sides, remove pork with slotted spoon and add to tomatillos. Cook remaining pork in skillet. Remove pork and garlic and add to tomatillos. Add onions and lightly brown. Add to tomatillo and pork mixture. Mix in tomatoes, jalapeno chiles, crushed red pepper and cilantro. Cover and cook over low heat 2 hours. (Chili can also be cooked in 350-degree oven 2 hours.)

Use a mandoline slicer or the slicing attachment of a food processor to slice the potatoes uniformly thin. A pound of dried beans, rice, or coins can be substituted for the pie weights. For an alternate method for unmolding the galette, see page 31.\nDIRECTIONS Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place potatoes in large bowl and fill with cold water. Using hands, swirl to remove excess starch, then drain in colander. Spread potatoes onto kitchen towels and thoroughly dry. Whisk 4 tablespoons butter, cornstarch, salt, pepper, and rosemary (if using) together in large bowl. Add dried potatoes and toss until thoroughly coated.

Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée the soup with a hand-held immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, use a standard blender to purée the soup in batches; see note.) Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If soup is too thin, simmer until thickened. If it\u0026rsquo;s too thick, add water or stock to thin it out. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired. Notes If using a standard blender to purée the soup: be sure not to fill the jar more than halfway; leave the hole in the lid open and cover loosely with a dishtowel to allow the heat to escape; and pour blended soup into a clean pot.\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions The soup can be frozen, without the cream, for up to 3 months. Defrost the soup in the refrigerator for 12 hours and then reheat it on the stovetop over medium heat until hot. Once heated through, add the cream and bring to a simmer before serving.\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/potato-leek-soup/","tags":null,"title":"Potato Leek Soup"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/potato-salad/","tags":null,"title":"potato salad"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A package for converting powerpoint files to markdown-beamer.\nrequires pandoc, powerpoint\nPackage URL: https://github.com/danb0b/code_ppt_unembed\n","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/code/powerpoint-to-markdown/","tags":["markdown","pandoc","office","presentations"],"title":"Powerpoint to Markdown Converter"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115 degrees F) 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 envelope active dry yeast 22 ounces all-purpose flour 2 ounces unsalted butter (melted) Vegetable oil (for the bowl and pan) 10 cups water 2/3 cup baking soda 1 large egg yolk (beaten with 1 tablespoon water) Pretzel salt Directions Combine the 1 1/2 cups warm water, the sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the mixture foams. Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size. Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with oil. Set aside. Bring the 10 cups water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in a 12-inch straight-sided saute pan or a roasting pan (something wide and shallow is best). Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place on a half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. One by one, place the pretzels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. Return them to the sheet pans, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture, and sprinkle with pretzel salt. Bake until dark golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving. If you don’t have pretzel salt, coarse sea salt will do.

Let the yeast soften, about 2 minutes; stir in the brown sugar and 1 cup flour with a wooden spoon. Dice 2 tablespoons butter and soften; stir into the mix. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and the fine salt to make a sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until smooth but still slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and grease a large baking sheet. Punch the dough to deflate it, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. (If the dough seems tight, cover and let rest until it relaxes.) Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll and stretch each piece with the palms of your hands into a 30-inch rope, holding the ends and slapping the middle of the rope on the counter as you stretch. Form each rope into a pretzel shape. Dissolve the baking soda in 3 cups warm water in a shallow baking dish. Gently dip each pretzel in the soda solution, then arrange on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.

Once"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients Pastry for a Double-Crust Pie: 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup shortening, chilled 6 tablespoons cold water Three-Berry Filling: 1 cup fresh strawberries, halved 2 cups fresh raspberries 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries 1/2 cup white sugar 3 tablespoons cornstarch Directions Combine the flour and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the pieces are the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the water over part of the mixture, then gently toss with a fork. Push moistened portion to the side of the bowl. Repeat, using 1 tablespoon of water at a time, until all is moistened. Divide the dough in half. Form each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Transfer one piece of dough to a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap the crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease the crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and cornstarch. Add the strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries; gently toss until berries are coated. Allow fruit mixture to stand for about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat. Roll out the remaining pastry for the top crust. Stir the berry mixture and pour the filling into the pastry-lined pie plate. Place the top crust over the pie and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges of the crust and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edge of the pie with foil. Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil. Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool on a wire rack.

Paste in the following:\nFROM python:3.11-bookworm WORKDIR /code RUN apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt install -y python3-distutils python3-pip \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ python -m pip install numpy scipy jupyter matplotlib pillow #... add any other packages here #RUN python -m pip install ... EXPOSE 8888 This short script is the recipe to create a new docker \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo;. A docker image is a static, portable, shareable, and minimal operating system, with everything you need to perform typically one task. In this case, the docker image starts from a release of Debian called \u0026ldquo;bookworm\u0026rdquo; with python 3.11 installed on top of it. From this base image, we install the numpy, scipy, jupyter, matplotlib, and pillow packages. This is enough to do some serious computing and plotting!\nBuild Script Next, in the top folder, create a new file called build.bash.\n#!/usr/bin/bash docker build ./build/ -t my_jupyter_image To build it for the first time, make it executable with chmod +x build.bash, then run it with\n. build.bash This will create a new image called \u0026ldquo;my_jupyter_image\u0026rdquo;\nWhy do I like to create my own build script? Because if I want to customize how I built the image, I can store that approach in a clearly-labeled file rather than remember I built it a certain way last time. (I can also comment out other approaches in case I want to switch back). There are a lot of other useful build options. For more ideas, see here\nJupyter Config File By default, Jupyter lab requires a token for logging on to the website, and normally when you boot up jupyter using jupyter lab, the command line will spit out a link with the token embedded in it. In a (personal) dockerized environment using docker compose, the token is not as easy to find on the command line, because the docker compose -d command will hide output from the container.\nIf you want to access the token, you have to access the container\u0026rsquo;s shell using\ndocker exec -it jupyter /bin/bash and then retrieve the token using the following command:\njupyter server list However, there is a different way. This config file sets the token and password to empty strings so that you can sign on without any password. in the ./jupyter-config folder, make jupyter_server_config.py with the following code inside:\nc.ServerApp.token = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; c.ServerApp.password = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Caution: as noted in the documentation, this approach is not intended for publicly accessible docker containers as it is a security issue. For a personal computing project, this should be just fine.\nDocker Compose This is the bare-bones implementation. The docker-compose.yaml file starts up a container called jupyter, using the \u0026ldquo;my_jupyter_image\u0026rdquo; image we built above. The docker-compose file can also build the image if needed, and looks for the same dockerfile in the ./build folder. We will access the container by the name jupyter when it is running. It will have access to two folders, the jupyter config folder we placed our config file in earlier, as well as a code folder. The locations on our machine are specified in the folder structure above\n--no-browser doesn\u0026rsquo;t launch theh browser --port=8888 specifies port 8888 for the website --allow-root allows the root user to launch it --ip=0.0.0.0 The address the Jupyter server will listen on. Specifying 0.0.0.0 allows the site to be available through docker version: \u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34; services: jupyter: image: my_jupyter_image:latest build: ./build container_name: jupyter volumes: - ./jupyter-config:/root/.jupyter - ./code:/code command: bash -c \u0026#34;jupyter lab --allow-root --ip=\u0026#39;0.0.0.0\u0026#39; --port=8888 --no-browser\u0026#34; ports: - 8888:8888 Putting it all together To bring up your new container, all you have to do is, from the top folder, call\ndocker compose up This will create a new running instance of your image, which we call a \u0026ldquo;container\u0026rdquo; in docker-speak. Once it is loaded and running, navigate in your browser to localhost:8888. A new jupyter lab window will open and provide access to your code/ folder and any files already inside.\nFuture work I hope to be able to share more examples of this approach to getting python running, with specific recipes we use in our lab, research, and classroom. Look out for more.\nWords of warning This solution does not work very well for cases that\nrequire hardware acceleration require opengl require PyQt5 or other GUIs this all comes down to the fact that docker out of the box does not support guis or connect well to user-specific hardware. I have gotten some workarounds to this, but nothing coherent enough that it provides a general solution to the above problems. So for now, its great for basic computing, but not so great for visualization or accelerated tasks.\nExternal Resources Docker info https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-run-jupyter-notebook-on-docker-7c9748ed209f https://medium.com/@18bhavyasharma/setting-up-and-running-jupyter-notebook-in-a-docker-container-d2acd713ce66 https://www.dataquest.io/blog/docker-data-science/ https://towardsdev.com/run-a-jupyter-notebook-in-a-docker-container-on-your-local-device-80ccd9570e4f About Docker Base Images https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images/ Jupyter setup and security https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operators/security.html# https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/configuration.html ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/notebook/docker/jupyter-in-docker/","tags":["python","jupyter","docker","linux","ubuntu"],"title":"Using Python in a Docker Container"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction This article shows the following:\nHow to create a custom user in a dockerfile how to setup ssh for easy login how to set up ssh for use with a physical network, even one through a wifi NIC (which has historically been harder) Folder structure . ├── build │ ├── Dockerfile ├── docker-compose.yaml Dockerfile FROM ubuntu:24.04 WORKDIR /test ENV MYUSER=danaukes ENV MYGROUP=danaukes ENV MYUID=1001 #1000 is taken by default by user ubuntu ENV MYGID=1001 #1000 is taken by default by group ubuntu RUN apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt install -y openssh-server iputils-ping git sudo net-tools RUN addgroup --gid ${MYGID} ${MYGROUP} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ useradd -p $(perl -e \u0026#39;print crypt($ARGV[0], \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; \u0026#39;test\u0026#39;) -u ${MYUID} -g ${MYGID} -G adm,sudo ${MYUSER} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ mkdir /home/${MYUSER} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ chown ${MYUSER}:${MYGROUP} /home/${MYUSER} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ echo \u0026#34;${MYUSER} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/sudoers.d/nopasswd RUN echo \u0026#34;PermitRootLogin yes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config RUN echo \u0026#34;PasswordAuthentication yes\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /etc/ssh/sshd_config USER ${MYUSER} Docker compose services: web: build: ./build user: danaukes networks: ubuntu-network: ipv4_address: \u0026#34;192.168.0.90\u0026#34; dns: - 192.168.0.1 ports: - 22:22 command: bash -c \u0026#34;sudo service ssh start \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sleep infinity\u0026#34; restart: unless-stopped networks: ubuntu-network: driver: ipvlan driver_opts: parent: wlp1s0 ipvlan-mode: l2 ipam: driver: default config: - subnet: 192.168.0.0/24 gateway: 192.168.0.1 ip_range: 192.168.0.0/24 Commands docker build --no-cache -t ssh ./build docker build -t ssh ./build docker compose build docker compose up docker compose down Comments Macvlan does not work with wifi but could also be substituted ipvlan l2 mode uses the same mac address, so accessing the container from your host may not be possible.

When the quinoa is done cooking, take it off the heat and set it aside for later. In a large dutch oven over medium heat, saute the diced onion in 3-4 tbsp of vegetable broth until it\u0026rsquo;s soft and translucent. Add minced garlic, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 1 ½ tbsp Italian seasonings, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp black pepper to the pot. Stir to combine and let it cook for a few minutes to toast the spices. Next, add the fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with the juice), diced bell peppers, green lentils, 1 tbsp maple syrup, and 4 cups of vegetable broth to the pot. Stir to combine and increase the heat to bring it to a low simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, and then let the soup cook for 25 minutes. Lastly, add the frozen spinach and the cooked quinoa and let it cook for 5 more minutes or until the spinach is warmed through. Notes Cook the quinoa in a separate pot and only add it to the soup right before you serve it. If you cook the quinoa in the soup, it will absorb most of the broth and the texture will be more like a stew. Don\u0026rsquo;t drain the juice from the can of fire-roasted tomatoes, it adds a lot of smoky flavor to the broth. Add the spinach at the end so it only cooks for about 5 minutes. By doing this, the spinach will retain its bright green color and make a prettier presentation. Store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 4-5 days or you can freeze it for a future meal.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data\nusing post method allows us to enter data from the form rather than the url bar. keeps the address bar clean\nusing the GET method allows us ot enter commands directly from address bar\nhowever the method includes the referal url which has the old data in it, so you must do a better job of parsing the

Generously butter and lightly flour two 8”x4” loaf pans. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and cinnamon. Stir gently to combine. Shred zucchini, lightly packing it down as you measure it. In the bowl of a stand mixer beat eggs, applesauce, oil, sugar and vanilla extract. Mix very well. Slowly add the dry ingredients (about 1/3 at a time) mixing as you go – then beat well to fully combine. With a rubber scraper or wooden spoon, stir in shredded zucchini and nuts into the batter and mix well. Pour half of the batter into each prepared pan. Bake for 45 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out cleanly. (The bake time will vary depending on how much shredded zucchini you add to the batter.) Remove from the pans and cool on wire racks. ","permalink":"https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/zucchihi-bread/","tags":null,"title":"Zucchini Bread"}]
