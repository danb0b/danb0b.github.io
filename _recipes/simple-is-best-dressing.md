## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter plus more for baking dish
* 1 pound good-quality day-old white bread, torn into 1" pieces (about 10 cups)
* 2 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions
* 1 1/2 cups 1/4" slices celery
* 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 2 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided
* 2 large eggs

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 250°F. Butter a 13x9x2" baking dish and set aside. Scatter bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 1 hour. Let cool; transfer to a very large bowl.
1. Meanwhile, melt 3/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add onions and celery. Stir often until just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add to bowl with bread; stir in herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle in 1 1/4 cups broth and toss gently. Let cool.
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk 1 1/4 cups broth and eggs in a small bowl. Add to bread mixture; fold gently until thoroughly combined. Transfer to prepared dish, cover with foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of dressing registers 160°F, about 40 minutes. DO AHEAD: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Uncover; let cool. Cover; chill.
1. Bake dressing, uncovered, until set and top is browned and crisp, 40-45 minutes longer (if chilled, add 10-15 minutes).

## Cooks' Note

Use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make this dish vegetarian-friendly.
