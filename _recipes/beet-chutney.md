* 1.5 kg or 3 lb 5oz raw beets, trimmed, peeled and diced
* 3 onions, chopped
* 3 apples, peeled and grated
* zest and juice of 3 oranges
* 2 tbsp white or yellow mustard seed
* 1 tbsp coriander seed
* 1 tbsp ground cloves
* 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
* 700ml / 1 1/4 pts red wine vinegar
* 700g / 1lb 9oz golden granulated sugar

## Directions

1. In a preserving pan or your largest saucepan, mix together all the ingredients well.  Bring to agentle simmer, then cook for 1 hr, stirring occasionally until the chutney is thick and the beets tender
1. While the chutney is cooking, prepare your jars by running through a short hot wash in your dishwasher.  Or wash thoroughly by hand, then put in a hot oven to sterilize for 10-15 min.  Once the chutney is ready, let it settle for 10 minutes, then carefully spoon into the jars and seal while still hot. You can eat it straight away but it will be even better after a month.  Will keep for up to 6 months in a cool dark place.  Once opened, refrigerate and eat within 2 months.
