## Ingredients

* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 medium onion
* 1 medium red pepper
* 2 stalks celery
* 2 medium carrots
* 1 lb (2 cups) dry uncooked black beans
* 1 tbsp olive oil or avocado oil
* 4 cups vegetable broth and 2 cups water

    or

    6 cups water and 1 ham hock

* 2 bay leaves
* ground pepper
* 2-3 tsp chili powder
* 2 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1/2 - 1 tsp oregano

### optional

* 1 cup salsa
* salt to taste -- add after

## Directions

1. Mince the garlic, dice the onion and celery, and grate the carrots on a large holed cheese grater. Rinse the black beans in a colander under cool running water and pick out any stones or debris.
1. Combine the garlic, onion, celery, carrots, black beans, salsa, chili powder, cumin, oregano, vegetable broth, and water in a 5-7 quart slow cooker. Stir well.
1. Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for 6-8 hours (you want the beans to get VERY soft).

    or

    1. pressure cook on high for 35 min
    1. let sit for 15 min
    1. manually release the remaining steam

1. Once the beans are very soft, use an immersion blender to blend the soup until it is thick and creamy (leave some beans whole if desired). Taste the soup and add salt if needed (this will depend on the brand of vegetable broth used).
