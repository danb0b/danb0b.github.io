## Ingredients

* ¼ cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small cubes
* 10 ounces baby bella mushrooms, sliced
* 1 large bunch of Rainbow chard (or traditional Swiss Chard), removed from stems and torn
* 1 large shallot, diced
* 4 cloves of garlic, minced
* 8 ounces Orecchiette pasta (or pasta of choice)
* 3½ cups reduced sodium chicken broth
* ¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
* Sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste

## Directions


1. In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper and add to pot, cooking for 5-6 minutes, until slightly browned. Add shallots and garlic and saute for ~2-3 minutes, until garlic is aromatic. Add chopped mushrooms, chard and another dash of salt and pepper. Saute for ~5-6 minutes, until mushrooms soften and chard wilts down.
1. Add pasta and chicken broth to pot. Bring to a boil and cook for 10-12 minutes, until most of the liquid is absorbed. Mix in parmesan cheese. Spoon into bowls and top with an extra sprinkle of cheese.
