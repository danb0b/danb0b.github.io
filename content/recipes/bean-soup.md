COOK TIME
8 minutes
TOTAL TIME
16 minutes



INGREDIENTS
1 (16 ounce) package dried pinto beans
5 cups water
1 (32 ounce) container beef broth - can substitute chicken or vegetable
1 large onion, chopped
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons salt
1 14.5 ounce can fire roasted tomatoes

INSTRUCTIONS
Place the beans in a bowl and cover with 5 cups of water. Soak overnight. Drain the beans and rinse.
Place beans, broth, onion and spices in the slow cooker. Cover and set to low. Cook for 8-hours on low or 4 on high.
You may find you need to add more liquid, as all slow cookers vary. I added about 2 more cups of beef stock to mine, to give us more broth.
minutes before serving, add the tomatoes and cover until ready.
Slightly mash your beans, leaving some whole.
Serve with toppings of choice..
