Dr. Aukes has developed a number of courses from scratch, including

* **Foldable Robotics:** A graduate-level course that teaches the design and analysis of foldable mechanisms, digital manufacturing, physical modeling and design optimization from the perspective of project-based applications where students design, build, validate, and improve their own robots.
* **Experimentation and Deployment of Robotic Systems:**  This course teaches about communication, sensing, data visualization, experiment design, computer vision, neural networks, and more.  The course is centered around developing data-driven decision making pipelines on real robotic systems using ROS2.
* **Flexible Robotics:** An undergraduate version of _Foldable Robotics_, with an emphasis on compliant systems, manual fabrication, and accessible modeling approaches via off-the-shelf physics engines.
* **Informal Robotics:** a course originally developed by Chuck Hoberman, Dan Aukes, and Jonathan Grinham at the Harvard University graduate school of design.  Focused on the iterative process of designing robotic systems made possible by "informal" materials.  This course was the progenitor of the engineering-focused "Foldable Robotics".

Dr. Aukes also frequently teaches

* **Embedded Systems Design Project I & II:** This is a 3rd year course sequence that takes students through the design, build, test process for embedded systems.  Students work in project teams to create user-centered designs that address a given need, with a focus on circuit design and debugging, PCB fabrication, microcontroller-level programming, analog and serial sensing, serial communication, and more.
