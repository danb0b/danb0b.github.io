## Daniel M. Aukes, PhD

I am an engineer and educator, having spent ten years as a professor in the field of robotics.  My goal is to help you build your knowledge of design and technology, get your hardware working, and propel your next idea to a working prototype and solid product concept.


### Key Skills

* Embedded Systems Development -- Board Design, Electo-Mechancial Systems, Embedded Software Integration.
* Mechanism Design and Modeling -- Visualization, Optimization, and Fabrication
* Software Development -- from embedded programming to database and web interactivity.
* System Automation -- From autonomous robots to assembly lines, I have extensive experience automating small and large systems.
* Physics Modeling, Experimentation, Data Collection, and Validation -- Build a digital twin of your system.
* Training & Course Development -- over a decade of experience mentoring young engineers through traditional course formats as well as informal advising and mentorship.

### Key Approaches

* A Python-forward approach to software design, other languages happily accommodated.
* Linux friendly
*

Daniel M. Aukes was a tenured professor in engineering and robotics at Arizona State University before leaving academia.  As the director of the IDEAlab, he investigated the nexus of design, manufacturing, and data-driven decision-making towards the development of robots that can operate in niche environments, with a focus on affordability and accessibility.  He is a former Technology Development Fellow at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University and completed post-doctoral research in the Harvard MicroRobotics Lab, developing manufacturing planning software for origami-inspired robots.  Dr. Aukes received his PhD and Masters degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University, studying the design of underactuated robotics hands.  He received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University.  

Dr. Aukes’s industry experiences have focused on manufacturing automation across a wide range of industries including automotive, pharmaceutical, and food-processing.
